<strong>Project</strong>: fabric-sdk-node<br><strong>Branch</strong>: master<br><strong>ID</strong>: 1553<br><strong>Subject</strong>: Initial implementation for sending endorser proposal<br><strong>Status</strong>: MERGED<br><strong>Owner</strong>: Jim Zhang - jim_the_matrix@hotmail.com<br><strong>Assignee</strong>:<br><strong>Created</strong>: 10/5/2016, 4:30:16 PM<br><strong>LastUpdated</strong>: 10/7/2016, 12:26:54 PM<br><strong>CommitMessage</strong>:<br><pre>Initial implementation for sending endorser proposal

To test, set up a network from the feature/convergence branch using a v1.0
docker-compose such as bddtests/bdd-docker/docker-compose-next-4.yml. Make
sure to map the ports by adding the "ports" section.

If you can't get this working in a native docker, you can run it inside
vagrant.

Run "node test/unit/endorser-tests.js"

Was trying to get this running end to end.  Assume of course I should be using code from the convergence branch and I started up solo, peer and membersrvc.  Getting an error from chaincode ([chaincode] processStream -> ERRO 150 Error handling chaincode support stream: connection error: desc = "transport is closing") but likely an issue with my setup.   How are you running these tests?</pre><strong>Reviewer</strong>: Christopher Ferris - chris.ferris@gmail.com<br><strong>Reviewed</strong>: 10/6/2016, 8:35:30 AM<br><strong>Message</strong>: <pre>Patch Set 2: Code-Review-1

we really need to be writing unit tests for every function we add. Does it work as expected, and does it correctly defend against bad arguments? We cannot be expecting that happy path derivative testing will catch all our bugs.</pre><strong>Reviewer</strong>: Christopher Ferris - chris.ferris@gmail.com<br><strong>Reviewed</strong>: 10/6/2016, 8:36:06 AM<br><strong>Message</strong>: <pre>Patch Set 2:

the unit tests should be mocked.</pre><strong>Reviewer</strong>: Jim Zhang - jim_the_matrix@hotmail.com<br><strong>Reviewed</strong>: 10/6/2016, 10:37:07 AM<br><strong>Message</strong>: <pre>Patch Set 2:

hi Chris, yes I'm getting that same error from the peer as well. But nonetheless getting success response like this:

{"response":{"status":200,"message":"Proposal accepted","payload":{"type":"Buffer","data":[]}},"actionBytes":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,64,202.....]}}

Meant to ask Jeff or Murali about the error even though it seems harmless.</pre><strong>Reviewer</strong>: Jim Zhang - jim_the_matrix@hotmail.com<br><strong>Reviewed</strong>: 10/6/2016, 10:43:37 AM<br><strong>Message</strong>: <pre>Patch Set 2:

Definitely, just trying to get this initial changeset in since the work by Bret and Anya on the orderer calls are dependent on legit Endorsement responses for testing (they are working on it in parallel but would need actual response objects to test end-to-end).

Submitted FAB-617 and 618 for adding more tests.</pre><strong>Reviewer</strong>: Gari Singh - gari.r.singh@gmail.com<br><strong>Reviewed</strong>: 10/6/2016, 12:24:34 PM<br><strong>Message</strong>: <pre>Patch Set 2:

So it turns out that as Jim mentioned the error I get is expected.  To really prove that the deployment works, you need to invoke a transaction</pre><strong>Reviewer</strong>: Gari Singh - gari.r.singh@gmail.com<br><strong>Reviewed</strong>: 10/6/2016, 12:29:00 PM<br><strong>Message</strong>: <pre>Patch Set 2:

I agree with Chris - if you could mock the backend for the unit tests, it would start a good trend</pre><strong>Reviewer</strong>: Jim Zhang - jim_the_matrix@hotmail.com<br><strong>Reviewed</strong>: 10/6/2016, 1:06:12 PM<br><strong>Message</strong>: <pre>Patch Set 2:
