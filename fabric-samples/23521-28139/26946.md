YeonHo, thanks for this contribution. Appreciate the effort. However, I think that this would be better handled as a Hyperledger Lab project. We are trying to keep the samples limited to the tutorials in the documentation as keeping them all up-to-date is quite an undertaking.

I would be willing to sponsor this as a hyperledger lab project.

by the way, I watched your video lecture from this course, https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:LinuxFoundationX+LFS171x+3T2017 .

It's very nice to see you again.</pre><strong>Reviewer</strong>: YeonHo Park - nicezic@naver.com<br><strong>Reviewed</strong>: 10/23/2018, 10:04:25 PM<br><strong>Message</strong>: <pre>Abandoned
