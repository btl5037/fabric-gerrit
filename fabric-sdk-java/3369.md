please add [WIP] to the title of the commit message to signify that it isn't to be merged in following the convention we are using for other Fabric projects - thanks</pre><strong>Reviewer</strong>: Muhammad Altaf - muhammada@fast.au.fujitsu.com<br><strong>Reviewed</strong>: 1/11/2017, 8:04:07 PM<br><strong>Message</strong>: <pre>Patch Set 3: Verified-1

Hi Rick,
 Were you able to run the test cases? I tried the ChainTest and it fails saying that "No peer available to respond". My peer is running at 7051. Further debugging shows that this is because of missing/invalid nonce in the header. Would you be able to fix it? Or may be we can merge it and fix it in another patch. Please let me know your thoughts.

Regards,
Altaf</pre><strong>Reviewer</strong>: Rick Rine - cr22rc@gmail.com<br><strong>Reviewed</strong>: 1/11/2017, 9:10:46 PM<br><strong>Message</strong>: <pre>Patch Set 3:

ChainTest never worked did it ?  I have full end2end running but its using a codebase that you cherry picked this from.  I updated transaction from that to make it current.  So you would need the proposal piece.   

Pardha was working on proposal submission and I understood you took it over from him and had it working.</pre><strong>Reviewer</strong>: Muhammad Altaf - muhammada@fast.au.fujitsu.com<br><strong>Reviewed</strong>: 1/11/2017, 9:21:30 PM<br><strong>Message</strong>: <pre>Patch Set 3: -Verified

That is what I wanted to clarify. That code that Pardha and myself were working before holidays, also contained signing stuff. I just returned from holidays and thought maybe you already figured out the complete flow.

Please change the commit message as Chris suggested.

Once commit message is updated, I Will merge your patch and then continue my changes on top of it.</pre><strong>Reviewer</strong>: Rick Rine - cr22rc@gmail.com<br><strong>Reviewed</strong>: 1/11/2017, 9:52:49 PM<br><strong>Message</strong>: <pre>Uploaded patch set 4: Commit message was updated.</pre><strong>Reviewer</strong>: Muhammad Altaf - muhammada@fast.au.fujitsu.com<br><strong>Reviewed</strong>: 1/11/2017, 9:54:21 PM<br><strong>Message</strong>: <pre>Patch Set 4: Code-Review+2 Verified+1</pre><strong>Reviewer</strong>: Gerrit Code Review - gerrit@hyperledger.org<br><strong>Reviewed</strong>: 1/11/2017, 9:54:31 PM<br><strong>Message</strong>: <pre>Change has been successfully merged by Muhammad Altaf</pre><strong>Reviewer</strong>: Rick Rine - cr22rc@gmail.com<br><strong>Reviewed</strong>: 1/11/2017, 9:56:21 PM<br><strong>Message</strong>: <pre>Patch Set 4:
