This fixed is needed for the enroll command to work correctly.
See fab-1918 for the command and the cryptic error which occurs.
This was also fixed in a later CR which has more than this
small change in it, so it is less risky to pull in this one
to make the enroll command work correctly in the alpha.
This works with or without the optional csr.json argument.

Gari, I note that you are being extremely kind these days, but let me try to help a little bit.

Keith: Let me quickly denote the first 10 issues that spring to mind with this CR:

* Tone *
1. I don't like the commit message statement that this is "required".
Are we really "required" to ignore a parameter?  (for alpha, next week's hack fest, or otherwise)... because of a confusing error message?

* Clarity / Provision of Information *
2. What EXACTLY is the problem with the "confusing" error message?
3. What IS that confusing error message? 
4. Please update the JIRA accordingly.
5. Can you provide us with details/info as to why it is "risky" to update (say, in this case) an error message ?

* Functionality *
This suggests to completely remove a feature (being able to specify a CSR as part of the enroll)
6. Any tests (before/after) the change? Shall we not "ascertain" that such a parameter is not passed in, rather than merely/silently ignore it?
7. Do we need to update the documentation?
8. Can we reproduce the error, and/or show that it does not pop-up with/without it?
9. The JIRA item states that this feature is no longer required... while it has been reproduced just a few weeks back. What has changed?

* Requirements, Requirements, Requirements - Design, Design, Design *
10. I actually remember people explaining to me (and others) how important it is/was to pass a CSR using JSON (even though I have never seen such design). For years I have been working with standard CSRs as if there was no care in the world. What has changed in the requirements?Or is it all driven by a confusing error message?
----

I'm sorry we are not jumping on any CR that states "this is required" anymore. See what happened to in master just over the last few days. Try to put yourself in other people's shoes:
- A maintainer who's supposed to approve it?
- A user/consumed, who learned that he/she needs to work with fabric-ca and providing such CSR (as per your request) and now, on such a fine Saturday morning - Jonathan has just merged it...</pre><strong>Reviewer</strong>: Jonathan Levi (HACERA) - jonathan@hacera.com<br><strong>Reviewed</strong>: 1/28/2017, 4:55:23 PM<br><strong>Message</strong>: <pre>Patch Set 1:

[The second item should have been:]

- A user/consumer, who has learned that he/she needs to work with fabric-ca by providing such CSRs (as per your request) and now, suddenly on such a fine Saturday morning - Jonathan has just merged it... (to avoid confusion?)

I understand (and it's true) that fabric 1.0 is considered heavily under "dev", but let's make it a little bit less painful/expensive for others to work/integrate with us? It can't be that difficult.</pre><strong>Reviewer</strong>: Keith Smith - keithsmithlfid@gmail.com<br><strong>Reviewed</strong>: 1/28/2017, 5:42:57 PM<br><strong>Message</strong>: <pre>Patch Set 1:

Jonathan, I certainly didn't intend any tone.
Since we have several CRs, I was asked which I considered
were the minimum set of required change sets for alpha, so that is why I used the word "required".
As I went through the instructions in the readthedocs manually,
assuming that is what alpha users would be doing, I came across this issue.  It was already fixed in a later unmerged CR, so in order to not ask maintainers to review any more changes than necessary and to not pull in any more changes than necessary to make the main functions in readthedocs work, I made this change.
I updated the jira item with the cryptic error message that you get without this fix.</pre><strong>Reviewer</strong>: Keith Smith - keithsmithlfid@gmail.com<br><strong>Reviewed</strong>: 1/28/2017, 6:26:38 PM<br><strong>Message</strong>: <pre>Uploaded patch set 2.</pre><strong>Reviewer</strong>: Hyperledger Jobbuilder - jobbuilder@jenkins.hyperledger.org<br><strong>Reviewed</strong>: 1/28/2017, 6:26:46 PM<br><strong>Message</strong>: <pre>Patch Set 2:

perhaps the right way to fix this is just to eliminate the -port option altogether (even for the server).  Not sure why we need it - you should be able to set it in the config moving forward.

Also - maybe it's time we start building separate executables for the client CLI and the server (of course in a different change set)</pre><strong>Reviewer</strong>: Keith Smith - keithsmithlfid@gmail.com<br><strong>Reviewed</strong>: 1/29/2017, 3:46:04 PM<br><strong>Message</strong>: <pre>Patch Set 3:

Gari, I think the right way to fix this post alpha is to not use cfssl's cli.Start at all.  Because we are using this, the only way to change the default port from 8888 to 7054 is to add a "-port 7054" to the command line if the "-port" option was not already specified.  This is what calls to util.SetDefaultServerPort do in cli/server/server.go and cli/client/client.go.  So this is why it would be confusing to the user, because the "-port 7054" option is added implicitly.

From my perspective for alpha, here are some options:
1) Update the readthedocs to always require a csr.json file be passed to the enroll command and make no code changes.
2) Remove the call to util.SetDefaultServerPort in cli/client/client.go.  I "think" this would work but wouldn't swear no other side-effects.
3) The current change in this change set.

Is there another option?
If not, I'm guessing #1?</pre><strong>Reviewer</strong>: Gari Singh - gari.r.singh@gmail.com<br><strong>Reviewed</strong>: 1/30/2017, 7:24:45 PM<br><strong>Message</strong>: <pre>Patch Set 3:

I think #2 would be best if it works.  doesn't the client actually take an explicit URL anyway (meaning it does not even use the value passed in via the cli parameter?)</pre><strong>Reviewer</strong>: Gari Singh - gari.r.singh@gmail.com<br><strong>Reviewed</strong>: 1/30/2017, 7:27:15 PM<br><strong>Message</strong>: <pre>Patch Set 3:

I figured that instead of getting angry every time I mistakenly (re)read this CR, especially after taking a look at the above - maybe I should simply remove my review score - and if you don't mind, I would like to use the opportunity to correct and practice my Gerrit's markdown syntax skills (as I feel that the majority of the below have been ignored - including the way in which I have requested that this "confusing error" will be tested):

Gari, patch set #4 uses approach #2 as you recommended (i.e. removing the call to util.SetDefaultServerPort from cli/client/client.go).  Thinking more about this, this change will cause some of Saad's unmerged change sets to fail because his cli simplification work made the server URL an optional command line arg.  That said, I agree that we can address post alpha, hopefully by not using cfssl's cli package at all, though the devil is the details there as I recall.

I also had already updated the readthedocs to always use the csr.json, so it works with or without this change set.

Jonathan, as far as I know, I responded to all of your comments.
In particular, 
1) I explained why I used the word "requirement", said that I intended no tone, and also removed it from the description.
2) I updated https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-1918 with more info showing the exact cryptic error message and how to reproduce.
3) I pushed another patch set, prior to your last comment, which allows the user to specify a csr.json.  That patch set also contained a test case to cover this.
4) I've not seen or heard previous comments regarding how we are using CFSSL.
If I missed something, pls let me know.</pre><strong>Reviewer</strong>: Jonathan Levi (HACERA) - jonathan@hacera.com<br><strong>Reviewed</strong>: 2/3/2017, 5:25:15 PM<br><strong>Message</strong>: <pre>Patch Set 4:
