This change makes it possible to embed the crypto material
from the cryptoconfig and cryptoPaths for the users of an organization
into the SDK's config.yaml.

The apiconfig.OrganizationConfig was updated with a the new field
`Users map[string]UserConfig`, which contains a map of the embedded
users, where `UserConfig` is:

type UserConfig struct {
    Key  string
    Cert string
}

Additionally, the default CredentialManager's constructor
and its method `GetSigningIdentity` were updated to make
use of the embedded users. `GetSigningIdentity` first checks if
an embedded user exists and if not, looks in the supplied cryptoPath.

Lastly, some logic was extracted from the `util.ImportBCCSPKeyFromPEM`
method into the `util.ImportBCCSPKeyFromPEMBytes` method in order
to allow importing of keys directly from a byte array rather than a file path.

Should I do this in this change request or in a separate one? The contribution guidelines mentioned that change requests should be as small as possible. Also, should we remove the capability for using the cryptoconfig and cryptopaths or leave them for backwards compatibility?

Also with this change, usernames become case insensitive due to how viper handles keys, which is a different behaviour compared to before, but is now consistent with how organization names are handled (which are also case insensitive). What are your thoughts on this?</pre><strong>Reviewer</strong>: Troy Ronda - troy@troyronda.com<br><strong>Reviewed</strong>: 12/18/2017, 7:30:14 AM<br><strong>Message</strong>: <pre>Patch Set 1:

In this case, I think it would be best to have both PEM and Path available together to remain consistent with the rest of the cert configs (i.e., at least merged at the ~ same time). 

For now, I think we should retain cryptopath as its useful for someone who is just getting started to use the tooling to generate the crypto artifacts and just specify the path to it. i.e., aids in a dev environment.

I think its okay - I don't think usernames should be considered different based on case anyways.</pre><strong>Reviewer</strong>: Baha A Shaaban - baha.shaaban@securekey.com<br><strong>Reviewed</strong>: 12/18/2017, 12:00:52 PM<br><strong>Message</strong>: <pre>Patch Set 1:

I have some questions about the desired behaviour of the paths config for loading user private keys and certificates.

Since we will have 3 ways of loading the certificates, what should the priorities be if all 3 are specified?

Additionally, if the preferred method is specified, but contains an invalid PEM, do we fall back to the next option if such is specified, or do we return an error directly?

Thirdly, if all methods fail, should the error contain the underlying reasons why each method failed with some kind of a multi-error or just say that something went wrong without specifying the errors that cause each failure?</pre><strong>Reviewer</strong>: Baha A Shaaban - baha.shaaban@securekey.com<br><strong>Reviewed</strong>: 12/20/2017, 4:15:20 PM<br><strong>Message</strong>: <pre>Patch Set 1:

I think the priorities should be loaded as follows:
1. CryptoConfig path (original behaviour useful for devs)
2. Embedded cert/key
3. File path cert/key

we just load the cert/key pair as is, if the call to 'tls.X509KeyPair' returns an error, it will just be returned to the client, the user/admin of the client must ensure whatever they configured is valid.</pre><strong>Reviewer</strong>: Emil Nikolov - emil.e.nikolov@gmail.com<br><strong>Reviewed</strong>: 12/20/2017, 4:45:58 PM<br><strong>Message</strong>: <pre>Patch Set 1:

I discussed the priorities with Troy quickly, please make CryptoConfig directory path the last priority as it's used only for dev purposes, real word scenarios will either embed or use your new User mechanism to load Client TLS cert/key pair. So the order of precedence must be:

 1. Embedded cert/key
 2. File path cert/key
 3. CryptoConfig path (original behaviour useful for devs)

On the other hand, it makes more sense to keep CryptoConfig path as the lowest priority as it's mainly used for dev purposes. So the precedence order should be:

1. Embedded cert/key
2. File path cert/key
3. CryptoConfig path (original behaviour useful for devs)</pre><strong>Reviewer</strong>: Emil Nikolov - emil.e.nikolov@gmail.com<br><strong>Reviewed</strong>: 12/22/2017, 8:37:13 AM<br><strong>Message</strong>: <pre>Patch Set 1:

Shouldn't the MutualTLSConfig also use TLSConfig internally? Right now it seems a bit inconsistent that some fields in the config file use TLSConfig, with Pem and Path (e.g. adminPrivateKey and signedCert), while others use MutualTLSConfig with keyPem and keyfile (e.g. client config).</pre><h1>PatchSets</h1><h3>PatchSet Number: 1</h3><blockquote><strong>Type</strong>: REWORK<br><strong>Author</strong>: Emil Nikolov - emil.e.nikolov@gmail.com<br><strong>Uploader</strong>: Emil Nikolov - emil.e.nikolov@gmail.com<br><strong>Created</strong>: 12/17/2017, 12:40:54 AM<br><strong>GitHubMergedRevision</strong>: [24f9ecc4a2f0f6eeb76eb26fc502e1e591e263b0](https://github.com/hyperledger-gerrit-archive/fabric-sdk-go/commit/24f9ecc4a2f0f6eeb76eb26fc502e1e591e263b0)<br><br><strong>Approver</strong>: Hyperledger Jobbuilder - jobbuilder@jenkins.hyperledger.org<br><strong>Approved</strong>: 12/17/2017, 1:20:55 AM<br><strong>Type</strong>: Verified<br><strong>Value</strong>: 1<br><br><strong>Approver</strong>: Troy Ronda - troy@troyronda.com<br><strong>Approved</strong>: 12/19/2017, 9:40:57 PM<br><strong>Type</strong>: Code-Review<br><strong>Value</strong>: 1<br><br><strong>MergedBy</strong>: Troy Ronda<br><strong>Merged</strong>: 12/20/2017, 12:33:03 PM<br><br><strong>Approver</strong>: Baha A Shaaban - baha.shaaban@securekey.com<br><strong>Approved</strong>: 12/20/2017, 11:28:42 AM<br><strong>Type</strong>: Code-Review<br><strong>Value</strong>: 1<br><br><h2>Comments</h2><strong>Commenter</strong>: Baha A Shaaban - baha.shaaban@securekey.com<br><strong>CommentLine</strong>: [.gitignore#L16](https://github.com/hyperledger-gerrit-archive/fabric-sdk-go/blob/24f9ecc4a2f0f6eeb76eb26fc502e1e591e263b0/.gitignore#L16)<br><strong>Comment</strong>: <pre>are you using Intellij?

type TLSConfig struct {
	Path string
	Pem string
}

The MutualTLSConfig has more fields than necessary. Also, my understanding is that the only other change needs to happen in the GetSigningIdentity of the CredentialManager in order to load the pems from the right place based on the priorities.</pre><strong>Commenter</strong>: Baha A Shaaban - baha.shaaban@securekey.com<br><strong>CommentLine</strong>: [api/apiconfig/network.go#L103](https://github.com/hyperledger-gerrit-archive/fabric-sdk-go/blob/24f9ecc4a2f0f6eeb76eb26fc502e1e591e263b0/api/apiconfig/network.go#L103)<br><strong>Comment</strong>: <pre>the embedded Client struct inside MutualTLSConfig makes more sense in your case as you have both cert and key pem and files path fields. I would pull out the Client struct out and rename it to ClientTLS and you can Make your Users variable be of type 'map[string]ClientTLS'

but be careful to look for all references to Client struct in MutualTLSConfig remain intact.</pre><strong>Commenter</strong>: Troy Ronda - troy@troyronda.com<br><strong>CommentLine</strong>: [internal/github.com/hyperledger/fabric-ca/util/csp.go#L131](https://github.com/hyperledger-gerrit-archive/fabric-sdk-go/blob/24f9ecc4a2f0f6eeb76eb26fc502e1e591e263b0/internal/github.com/hyperledger/fabric-ca/util/csp.go#L131)<br><strong>Comment</strong>: <pre>extra tab</pre><strong>Commenter</strong>: Baha A Shaaban - baha.shaaban@securekey.com<br><strong>CommentLine</strong>: [internal/github.com/hyperledger/fabric-ca/util/csp.go#L133](https://github.com/hyperledger-gerrit-archive/fabric-sdk-go/blob/24f9ecc4a2f0f6eeb76eb26fc502e1e591e263b0/internal/github.com/hyperledger/fabric-ca/util/csp.go#L133)<br><strong>Comment</strong>: <pre>this error message should be set between lines 142 and 143 below.

We should also follow up with the capability for keys in the HSM (as with other keys in the config).</pre><strong>Commenter</strong>: Baha A Shaaban - baha.shaaban@securekey.com<br><strong>CommentLine</strong>: [test/fixtures/config/config_test_embedded_pems.yaml#L255](https://github.com/hyperledger-gerrit-archive/fabric-sdk-go/blob/24f9ecc4a2f0f6eeb76eb26fc502e1e591e263b0/test/fixtures/config/config_test_embedded_pems.yaml#L255)<br><strong>Comment</strong>: <pre>I agree with Troy, we should use 'pem' and 'path' for all the entries to allow both embedded (pem) or file (path) values</pre><strong>Commenter</strong>: Troy Ronda - troy@troyronda.com<br><strong>CommentLine</strong>: [test/fixtures/config/config_test_embedded_pems.yaml#L335](https://github.com/hyperledger-gerrit-archive/fabric-sdk-go/blob/24f9ecc4a2f0f6eeb76eb26fc502e1e591e263b0/test/fixtures/config/config_test_embedded_pems.yaml#L335)<br><strong>Comment</strong>: <pre>extra space</pre></blockquote>
