Added option to pass a JSON file as a parameter to the scripts in this
folder.
The JSON file contains default organization names and MSP IDs as keys,
and custom names and IDs as values.
Channel artifacts, cryptographic material, and docker-compose files are
created using custom names if a file is provided as a parameter.
If no mapping is specified for a given organization name or MSP ID in
the file or if no file is specified, the default names and IDs are used.

Yes, we can use the sample org map in the README too.

The reason I placed 'orgMap.json' in the directory under PTE was because I thought it would be appropriate to scope all application-specific settings and logic in one folder. (The folder 'tools/PTE/ccArgumentsGenerator/<cc-type>/' already contains transaction-generation logic specific to <cc-type>.)

We can also create application-specific sub-folders within 'NL', just like in 'PTE'. I didn't do that only because it seemed to me that 'NL' was envisioned to be application-agnostic, unlike PTE.</pre><strong>Reviewer</strong>: Scott Zwierzynski - scottz@us.ibm.com<br><strong>Reviewed</strong>: 8/23/2018, 9:44:06 AM<br><strong>Message</strong>: <pre>Patch Set 1:

Yes we should use the same sample path/file example in the readme as well as the script itself.
My point was that I would not think to look for these new name conversion files in a directory for chaincode arguments. Would you say this converter map fle is chaincode specific? Or testcase specific? Or network specific? It seems you are putting the sample file under NL/ but that there would be one for each network that PTE could use for multiple tests. How about if we create a new directory PTE/orgmaps/ and put the sample file there? Or just put it at PTE/sampleOrgMap.json ?</pre><strong>Reviewer</strong>: Ramakrishna V - vramakr2@in.ibm.com<br><strong>Reviewed</strong>: 8/23/2018, 3:12:31 PM<br><strong>Message</strong>: <pre>Patch Set 1:

I have been using the converter map file in a chaincode-specific way, but upon reflection, I believe it ought to be network-specific. (More than one chaincode can very well use a common map.) I think it's best to associate this file only with NL and leave PTE completely out of it. As you stated in your other comment, someone who runs PTE on a custom business network must already have generated an appropriate network and configuration files, either using NL or some other mechanism.

I'll just change the file reference to NL/sampleOrgMap.json and resubmit if you are OK with it.</pre><strong>Reviewer</strong>: Scott Zwierzynski - scottz@us.ibm.com<br><strong>Reviewed</strong>: 8/23/2018, 7:07:52 PM<br><strong>Message</strong>: <pre>Patch Set 1:

I usually prefer more comments rather than less, so let's keep the comments in the readme in the PTE directory too. But do make the examples in the Readme files and in the sh files consistent. And if you suggest putting them anywhere inside PTE, just leave them at top level at PTE/. Would that work?</pre><strong>Reviewer</strong>: Ramakrishna V - vramakr2@in.ibm.com<br><strong>Reviewed</strong>: 8/24/2018, 8:24:29 AM<br><strong>Message</strong>: <pre>Uploaded patch set 2.</pre><strong>Reviewer</strong>: Ramakrishna V - vramakr2@in.ibm.com<br><strong>Reviewed</strong>: 8/24/2018, 8:25:33 AM<br><strong>Message</strong>: <pre>Patch Set 2:

Yes, that works. I made changes accordingly. Please check out the latest patch set.</pre><strong>Reviewer</strong>: Hyperledger Jobbuilder - jobbuilder@jenkins.hyperledger.org<br><strong>Reviewed</strong>: 8/24/2018, 8:28:48 AM<br><strong>Message</strong>: <pre>Patch Set 2:
