This is the initial commit for the fabric-test
repository containing automated tests and tools.

This is a port from the fabric repository with the
exception of changing a few files to use the new
directory structure to ensure that tests will run.

This also includes setting fabric and fabric-ca as
submodules within this repository as dependencies.

There are also the removal of a few superfluous files.

I realize there are some more files to fix or delete or comments to cleanup, by other test owners in some areas (chaincodes, and tests and automation scripts under regression/), so we can sllow the owners to take care of that when they fix up their tests in this new fabric-test directory structure in the coming days. I did notice just a few more files under feature/ named *.txt or *bak that you could possibly delete, plus a few edits are required in readme file.</pre><strong>Reviewer</strong>: Latitia Haskins - latitia.haskins@gmail.com<br><strong>Reviewed</strong>: 7/28/2017, 10:39:50 AM<br><strong>Message</strong>: <pre>Patch Set 3: Verified+1

I've also added the fabric-ca submodule and removed a few other superfluous files.</pre><strong>Reviewer</strong>: Latitia Haskins - latitia.haskins@gmail.com<br><strong>Reviewed</strong>: 7/28/2017, 10:40:16 AM<br><strong>Message</strong>: <pre>Uploaded patch set 4.</pre><strong>Reviewer</strong>: Latitia Haskins - latitia.haskins@gmail.com<br><strong>Reviewed</strong>: 7/28/2017, 11:01:08 AM<br><strong>Message</strong>: <pre>Patch Set 4: Verified+1</pre><strong>Reviewer</strong>: Adnan C - adnan.choudhury@itpeoplecorp.com<br><strong>Reviewed</strong>: 7/28/2017, 1:11:40 PM<br><strong>Message</strong>: <pre>Patch Set 4: Code-Review+1

In many of the files import path is referring to "github.com/hyperledger/fabric" but as we are using submodule for fabric we don't fabric code referring in that directory hence getting below error message 

can't load package: package github.com/hyperledger/fabric/core/chaincode/shim: cannot find package "github.com/hyperledger/fabric/core/chaincode/shim" in any of:

Either we have to ask users to build docker images before they use this repo or fix the above issue.</pre><strong>Reviewer</strong>: Latitia Haskins - latitia.haskins@gmail.com<br><strong>Reviewed</strong>: 7/31/2017, 10:48:45 AM<br><strong>Message</strong>: <pre>Patch Set 4:

I have opened an issue: https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-5545 to change the Makefile to allow for a different directory structure when using fabric as a git submodule. This will allow one to build images and executables in this repo.

@rameshthoomu: Also, while I have pulled over most of what will be used in this repo, the idea and plan was to allow each tool owner to modify their tool to ensure that it works as expected with the new structure.  My current responsibility is with the behave tests in the feature dir. The necessary changes were made such that these tests were executed successfully.</pre><strong>Reviewer</strong>: Ramesh Babu Thoomu - rameshbabu.thoomu@gmail.com<br><strong>Reviewed</strong>: 8/1/2017, 10:48:50 AM<br><strong>Message</strong>: <pre>Removed Code-Review-1 by Ramesh Babu <rameshbabu.thoomu@gmail.com>

So user has to build docker images and binaries before leverage fabric-test repository. It's better to add README with these instructions.

Yes, There is a story (FAB-5546) that is being used to track all of the work that is needed in order to have this repo ready for use. This is the first commit in what will be a series of commits.</pre><strong>Reviewer</strong>: Scott Zwierzynski - scottz@us.ibm.com<br><strong>Reviewed</strong>: 8/4/2017, 4:52:12 PM<br><strong>Message</strong>: <pre>Patch Set 4: Code-Review+1

Approved, based on these reasons for using git submodules inside fabric-test for the fabric and other repos being tested:
 + this mechanism works for release branch testing as well as daily
   testing of fabric master dev branch
 + it is simpler to update git submodules than using vendoring for
   entire fabric repo inside fabric-test
 + follows precedent; the composer repo also includes fabric as
   git submodule
 + fabric-test scripts have dependencies: they refer to protobufs,
   chaincodes, and e2e examples in fabric dirs
 + we have no need to modify code inside any fabric-test/submodules
 + user need only to clone fabric-test and successfully run tests
   with a working combination of commits for all repos
 + it is not meant to be a development environment for chaincode
   application developers who may rather use vendoring, but
   note our existing behave framework does provide an easy way to
   plug in and test their chaincode APIs.

Other plans to leverage this work in future, for automation testing:
 + Enhance the automation jenkins job that triggers fabric UT and
   merges fabric CRs: once merge is verified successful, then
   the job should also do:
   (1) push images to nexus and tag with commit level and "latest"
   (2) update git submodules and run smoke tests in fabric-test repo
 + Create a new cron job to run a jenkins job for daily test suite,
   pulling the latest images from nexus which match the commit level
   of the submodules saved inside fabric-test submodules images.
   (OR, we could ask this daily job to perform (2); this would be ok
   because only successfully tested CRs will have been merged and
   images pushed. However, in that case then we would not be running
   smoke tests for every fabric commit change.)</pre><strong>Reviewer</strong>: Scott Zwierzynski - scottz@us.ibm.com<br><strong>Reviewed</strong>: 8/7/2017, 12:40:50 PM<br><strong>Message</strong>: <pre>Patch Set 4: Code-Review+2</pre><strong>Reviewer</strong>: Scott Zwierzynski - scottz@us.ibm.com<br><strong>Reviewed</strong>: 8/7/2017, 12:42:55 PM<br><strong>Message</strong>: <pre>Change has been successfully merged by Scott Zwierzynski</pre><h1>PatchSets</h1><h3>PatchSet Number: 1</h3><blockquote><strong>Type</strong>: REWORK<br><strong>Author</strong>: Latitia Haskins - latitia.haskins@gmail.com<br><strong>Uploader</strong>: Latitia Haskins - latitia.haskins@gmail.com<br><strong>Created</strong>: 7/27/2017, 5:38:06 PM<br><strong>UnmergedRevision</strong>: 9a52b0f3d0ca72562bf827c64ca44a56e186e786<br><br></blockquote><h3>PatchSet Number: 2</h3><blockquote><strong>Type</strong>: REWORK<br><strong>Author</strong>: Latitia Haskins - latitia.haskins@gmail.com<br><strong>Uploader</strong>: Latitia Haskins - latitia.haskins@gmail.com<br><strong>Created</strong>: 7/27/2017, 5:42:15 PM<br><strong>UnmergedRevision</strong>: 74905112cf20960a63e248d7b6a11832408013ef<br><br></blockquote><h3>PatchSet Number: 3</h3><blockquote><strong>Type</strong>: NO_CODE_CHANGE<br><strong>Author</strong>: Latitia Haskins - latitia.haskins@gmail.com<br><strong>Uploader</strong>: Latitia Haskins - latitia.haskins@gmail.com<br><strong>Created</strong>: 7/27/2017, 5:44:51 PM<br><strong>UnmergedRevision</strong>: 9131bba430604d6ab381dd4685c74413c4f925d6<br><br><strong>Approver</strong>: Scott Zwierzynski - scottz@us.ibm.com<br><strong>Approved</strong>: 7/27/2017, 9:32:42 PM<br><strong>Type</strong>: Code-Review<br><strong>Value</strong>: -1<br><br><strong>Approver</strong>: Latitia Haskins - latitia.haskins@gmail.com<br><strong>Approved</strong>: 7/28/2017, 10:39:50 AM<br><strong>Type</strong>: Verified<br><strong>Value</strong>: 1<br><br></blockquote><h3>PatchSet Number: 4</h3><blockquote><strong>Type</strong>: REWORK<br><strong>Author</strong>: Latitia Haskins - latitia.haskins@gmail.com<br><strong>Uploader</strong>: Latitia Haskins - latitia.haskins@gmail.com<br><strong>Created</strong>: 7/28/2017, 10:40:16 AM<br><strong>GitHubMergedRevision</strong>: [83894fbc882453c7da4f7e3caff65750708478f2](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-test/commit/83894fbc882453c7da4f7e3caff65750708478f2)<br><br><strong>Approver</strong>: Ramesh Babu Thoomu - rameshbabu.thoomu@gmail.com<br><strong>Approved</strong>: 8/1/2017, 12:17:19 PM<br><strong>Type</strong>: Code-Review<br><strong>Value</strong>: 1<br><br><strong>Approver</strong>: Scott Zwierzynski - scottz@us.ibm.com<br><strong>Approved</strong>: 8/7/2017, 12:40:50 PM<br><strong>Type</strong>: Code-Review<br><strong>Value</strong>: 1<br><br><strong>MergedBy</strong>: Scott Zwierzynski<br><strong>Merged</strong>: 8/7/2017, 12:42:55 PM<br><br><strong>Approver</strong>: Latitia Haskins - latitia.haskins@gmail.com<br><strong>Approved</strong>: 7/28/2017, 11:01:08 AM<br><strong>Type</strong>: Verified<br><strong>Value</strong>: 1<br><br><strong>Approver</strong>: Adnan C - adnan.choudhury@itpeoplecorp.com<br><strong>Approved</strong>: 7/28/2017, 1:11:40 PM<br><strong>Type</strong>: Code-Review<br><strong>Value</strong>: 1<br><br></blockquote>
