Please do the rebase operation, no need to abandon old ones.

You can see the documentation to find how to do the rebase.

In the previous commit, I have commented the yeasy/ images instead of removing them. The current one has only has necessary images. Or should I rebase the old one and again make some modifications and commit with an amend?</pre><strong>Reviewer</strong>: indirajith vijai ananth - indirajithv@gmail.com<br><strong>Reviewed</strong>: 7/18/2017, 4:17:36 AM<br><strong>Message</strong>: <pre>Abandoned</pre><h1>PatchSets</h1><h3>PatchSet Number: 1</h3><blockquote><strong>Type</strong>: REWORK<br><strong>Author</strong>: indirajith vijai ananth - indirajithv@gmail.com<br><strong>Uploader</strong>: indirajith vijai ananth - indirajithv@gmail.com<br><strong>Created</strong>: 7/16/2017, 4:31:53 PM<br><strong>UnmergedRevision</strong>: 49daddb3ff1def4eca326b1c67f9d4b6de8783e8<br><br><strong>Approver</strong>: Hyperledger Jobbuilder - jobbuilder@jenkins.hyperledger.org<br><strong>Approved</strong>: 7/16/2017, 4:40:46 PM<br><strong>Type</strong>: Verified<br><strong>Value</strong>: 1<br><br></blockquote>
