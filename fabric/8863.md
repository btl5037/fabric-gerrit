reported for lockbasedtxmgr.

Dave, one of the reason I had put these in the `commontests` was that these tests are reusable for a different scheme of transaction management (other than the lock based).

In order to meet the purpose of the code coverage by the tests in the same package, we can organize this as below
- Make the interface 'testEnv' as public and Test* functions take additional parameter []testEnv
- Move the implementations of this interface ('testEnv') to 'lockbasedtxmgr' package
- In the package 'lockbasedtxmgr', have Test* function that invokes corresponding Test* in 'commontests' package
This is similar to the way we have tests for statedb e.g. - https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/core/ledger/kvledger/txmgmt/statedb/commontests/test_common.go#L29

If you do not want to limit the changes then we can omit the step first and second bullet in the above and instead - 
Introduce a function in 'commontests' package that would set the 'testEnvs' variable to `[]testEnv{&levelDBLockBasedEnv{}, &couchDBLockBasedEnv{}}`
In the package 'lockbasedtxmgr', we can set the 'testEnvs' variable (in the TestMain) and have Test* functions in 'lockbasedtxmgr' invoke corresponding Test* in 'commontests'.</pre><strong>Reviewer</strong>: Manish Sethi - manish.sethi@gmail.com<br><strong>Reviewed</strong>: 5/4/2017, 12:53:56 AM<br><strong>Message</strong>: <pre>Patch Set 1:

Sorry... just noticed a typo in the previous comment. Read "do not want to limit" as "want to limit" :-)</pre><strong>Reviewer</strong>: Gari Singh - gari.r.singh@gmail.com<br><strong>Reviewed</strong>: 5/4/2017, 7:12:35 AM<br><strong>Message</strong>: <pre>Patch Set 1:

I think this is another sign that we have WAY too many "folders" / "packages".  This is a problem throughout the fabric codebase.

For example, I don't think you need any folders under txmgmt/txmgr  (honestly I would go further and not have any folders under txmmgmt either)

You are already proving this with common tests</pre><strong>Reviewer</strong>: Gari Singh - gari.r.singh@gmail.com<br><strong>Reviewed</strong>: 5/4/2017, 8:13:15 AM<br><strong>Message</strong>: <pre>Patch Set 1:

Helps if you finish your thought before submitting ....  so would it be possible to flatten the folder structure rather than trying to move tests around and write wrappers around common tests?</pre><strong>Reviewer</strong>: Manish Sethi - manish.sethi@gmail.com<br><strong>Reviewed</strong>: 5/5/2017, 8:03:31 AM<br><strong>Message</strong>: <pre>Patch Set 1:

Hi Gari - IMO, flattening would mix-up the code that is otherwise completely unrelated. For instance, it won't be a good idea to have in the same folder 
the code related to leveldb and couchdb, (and going forward if we have more impls) - [I am taking this example because this a concrete and both the implementation are in place].

I looked around to double check on what is common practice for tests in this situation - where a similar behaviour is expected from different impls. 
I looked at LedisDB (which provides a common set of APIs over different KV-stores). They also have an approach similar to what we have (https://github.com/siddontang/ledisdb/tree/master/store) - See store_test.go in this package.

Similarly, Golang libs also use separate package for separate implementation of a common interface.
For example https://github.com/golang/go/tree/master/src/hash, https://github.com/golang/go/tree/master/src/image, and https://github.com/golang/go/tree/master/src/encoding etc.
Though, they don't have common tests because, I guess the impls differ in behaviour.

Also, came across a similar query on stackoverflow (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15897803/how-can-i-have-a-common-test-suite-for-multiple-packages-in-go)

Though, I am open to go along with the collective decision but, based on above findings, I am personally more convinced of the approach we have adopted here...</pre><strong>Reviewer</strong>: Manish Sethi - manish.sethi@gmail.com<br><strong>Reviewed</strong>: 5/5/2017, 8:19:15 AM<br><strong>Message</strong>: <pre>Patch Set 1:

As far as "write wrappers around common tests" is concerned, an alternate to overcome this could be to make changes in CI to include the code coverage by the commontests package. In the current form, it only captures the coverage from the current package. The following flag makes it to work..
go test -cover -coverpkg github.com/hyperledger/fabric/core/ledger/kvledger/txmgmt/txmgr/lockbasedtxmgr

I am not sure though whether this is easier get done in CI or wrapping tests in the same package is better...</pre><strong>Reviewer</strong>: Christopher Ferris - chris.ferris@gmail.com<br><strong>Reviewed</strong>: 5/29/2017, 8:11:30 PM<br><strong>Message</strong>: <pre>Patch Set 1: Code-Review+2</pre><strong>Reviewer</strong>: Gari Singh - gari.r.singh@gmail.com<br><strong>Reviewed</strong>: 6/2/2017, 4:19:59 PM<br><strong>Message</strong>: <pre>Patch Set 1: Code-Review+2</pre><strong>Reviewer</strong>: Gerrit Code Review - gerrit@hyperledger.org<br><strong>Reviewed</strong>: 6/2/2017, 4:20:02 PM<br><strong>Message</strong>: <pre>Change has been successfully merged by Gari Singh</pre><strong>Reviewer</strong>: Hyperledger Jobbuilder - jobbuilder@jenkins.hyperledger.org<br><strong>Reviewed</strong>: 6/2/2017, 4:20:13 PM<br><strong>Message</strong>: <pre>Patch Set 1:
