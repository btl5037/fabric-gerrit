CC code

Chaincode is provides access to state via code that
manipulates and queries state. Currently fabric does
not prescribe models for how to organize he code that
makes up the chaincode. GO chaincodes for instance
have all the manipulating code specified at the the
time of install. Thus the only way to modify/extend the
chaincode is via lifecycle operations such as update or
a new install. Allowing code to be bound at runtime has
significant benefits to how the chaincode is modelled,
ownership determined, new services are added, and so on.
A side-effect of this approach is that code becomes part
of state more directly (think the old 0.5 model where
code was saved on the ledger). This is a good thing. In
effect we have a hybrid model where the core code is
part of the chaincode and the ancillary code can be
attached to the CC post instantiation.

While the fabric never directly prevented such late-bound
modeling, the chaincode implementation languages effectively
did precisely that. This EXPERIMENTAL CR uses Clojure on top
of the Java runtime to break through that impediment to
loose-coupling so we can  have a concrete framework to
reason about both approaches to chaincode modeling.

It should be moted that this code does not touch the fabric
or shim in at all!  In other words, users can use the
modeling sketches presented here right away.  However, to
realize the full potential of the approach, it would be
good to structure the chaincode framework (at least with
languages such as Clojure) to deliberately promote such a
programming model.

Agreed. For that matter we could also illustrated with GO with its lib loading capabilities now.
But though the language is a bit besides the point - now that you bring it up ;-) - a side effect of this CR is to bring out the expressive power of using Clojure.  It was much easier for me to work with it - few lines of code will all the power of functional programming waiting to be tapped.</pre><strong>Reviewer</strong>: Srinivasan Muralidharan - srinivasan.muralidharan99@gmail.com<br><strong>Reviewed</strong>: 4/2/2018, 11:02:11 AM<br><strong>Message</strong>: <pre>Abandoned
