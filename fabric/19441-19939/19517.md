I “fixed” it because I had no idea if it was being used in any way but anyone but it was preventing `go test ./...` from working.

If you think it’s dead, I’m more than happy to delete it. In fact, I’ll do that now and if people don’t think it’s dead, they can -1.</pre><strong>Reviewer</strong>: Matthew Sykes - sykesmat@us.ibm.com<br><strong>Reviewed</strong>: 3/21/2018, 10:16:12 AM<br><strong>Message</strong>: <pre>Patch Set 1:

Code is deleted in a CR further in the chain. I'm leaving this to avoid another set of build flakes that will inevitably occur if I need to rebase.</pre><strong>Reviewer</strong>: Artem Barger - bartem@il.ibm.com<br><strong>Reviewed</strong>: 3/22/2018, 6:04:13 PM<br><strong>Message</strong>: <pre>Change has been successfully merged by Artem Barger</pre><strong>Reviewer</strong>: Hyperledger Jobbuilder - jobbuilder@jenkins.hyperledger.org<br><strong>Reviewed</strong>: 3/22/2018, 6:32:36 PM<br><strong>Message</strong>: <pre>Patch Set 1:
