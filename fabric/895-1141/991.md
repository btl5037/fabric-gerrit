This patch updated protobuf link from v3.0.0 to v3.0.2.
FAB-309 reported that there was no link to get gmock packages which was
required to build protobuf v3.0.0-beta-3. FAB-108 upgraded protobuf from
v3.0.0-beta-3 to v3.0.0. But the link to gmock packages was not fixed in
protobuf v3.0.0. This link was fixed in protobuf v3.0.2.

Fixes FAB-309

I see no problem with updating, but we will have to spin baseimage v0.0.12 to pull this in.  I'm also confused where the gmock problems are coming from because the baseimage appears to build ok for me.</pre><strong>Reviewer</strong>: Greg Haskins - gregory.haskins@gmail.com<br><strong>Reviewed</strong>: 9/9/2016, 6:01:17 PM<br><strong>Message</strong>: <pre>Patch Set 1:

Ok, after reviewing FAB-309 I think I understand.  The issue is occuring on platforms that do not have a prebuilt baseimage (presumably alt-arch like Z or ppc).  

Because this change does not go through CI, can you confirm that you can run unit-tests/behave/sdk-unit-tests and then this can be merged.</pre><strong>Reviewer</strong>: Hyperledger Jobbuilder - jobbuilder@jenkins.hyperledger.org<br><strong>Reviewed</strong>: 9/9/2016, 6:14:01 PM<br><strong>Message</strong>: <pre>Patch Set 1: Verified-1

Yes. I checked always unite-tests/behabe/node-sdk-unti-tests before sending a patch. I think that this failure is CI environments network problem because some package could not get from outside.</pre><strong>Reviewer</strong>: Greg Haskins - gregory.haskins@gmail.com<br><strong>Reviewed</strong>: 9/10/2016, 8:30:26 AM<br><strong>Message</strong>: <pre>Patch Set 1: Code-Review+2

Sorry, I wasn't implying the CI failures were related.  What I meant was that CI would not cover this change (since x86 is able to pull from dockerhub and CI doesnt use vagrant devenv).  I therefore wanted to ensure that it had been tested explicitly</pre><strong>Reviewer</strong>: Ry Jones - ry@linux.com<br><strong>Reviewed</strong>: 9/10/2016, 2:14:01 PM<br><strong>Message</strong>: <pre>Patch Set 1:
