[FAB-5280] Fix git clone fabric-samples for Windows

This change expands the prerequisites documentation for Windows
to instruct users on setting git properly to ensure it handles
long filenames (required to successfully clone fabric-samples)
and end-of-lines (required for vagrant to work).

[FAB-5293] Log buffer overflow events

This commit adds a logging event when a message is dropped
due to overflow of the connection buffer to a remote peer

FAB-5331 Fix formatting of channel name

[]byte instead of in *string*s.

[FAB-5309] Set mod_policy for new channel policies

The current configtxgen creates a channel creation tx with policies of
Reader/Writer/Admin, where these each do not have a mod_policy set.
This makes it difficult to change these policies, because the policy
does not exist.

It is possible through a roundabout way to change these policies (by
removing and re-adding the policy with a different mod_policy), but this
is certainly not a painless procedure and requires assistance of the
orderer org.

This CR updates to configtx processing to validate mod_policy values
such that they are valid names.  This means that the policy is not
empty, and if the policy is path specified (ie using '/'), that each
component of the path can be described as a valid config element (does
not violate the config element naming rules).

This CR additionally sets the mod_policy on the policies generated by
configtxgen to "Admins".

For users of the old v1.0.0 configtxgen, channel creation will fail with
an error for v1.0.1 orderers.  However, v1.0.1 configtxgen users will
have their transaction appropriately consumed by v1.0.0 orderers.

So in summary, upgrading configtxgen without fabric is okay.  Upgrading
fabric without configtxgen will cause breakage for new channel creation.

An additional bug in the configtxgen output was discovered which was not
setting a mod_policy on the anchor peers element.  There was also an
error in the bddtests which mimic the missing policies for the
application level policies.

This CR simply causes solo to re-query the batch timeout from the config
each time the timer is initialized, rather than once at creation time.

[FAB-5365] Fix bad error in peer CLI Deliver

The peer CLI currently attempts to print the error status returned by
the orderer's Deliver gRPC method.  However, the log statement
inappropriately uses the '%T' modifier, and prints the type of the
status, not the actual status code inside it.  Consequently, all deliver
errors read the same uninformative error message:

    Got Status:*orderer.DeliverResponse_Status

This CR fixes this log statement to include the status code instead, and
additionally enhances the other error messages with pertitent
information.

[FAB-5330] Prevent payload buffer overpopulation

The state transfer module receives blocks from either the orderer
or other peers, and puts them into a payload buffer for reordering so
they would enter the ledger in-order.

In some cases:
- If the peer joined late and it receives blocks from peers starting from
  index i where the ledger is missing indices [j, i] for some j<i
  and the rate of block reception from peers is very fast
- If the ledger is "stuck" (i.e file system full, etc.) and cannot advance

This buffer would overpopulate.

This commit addresses this, and adds a maximum distance constant
that if the difference between the ledger height and the sequence
of the block that is received is greater than this constant,
the block is dropped.

[FAB-5353]: Qualify sys. failure vs validation error

Currently as stated in [FAB-5353], there is no clear separation during
transaction validation during block commmit, between invalid transaction
and some system failure which migh lead to inability to validate the
transaction. For example db is down or file system is unavailable. This
might lead to inconsistency of the state accross peers, therefore this
commit takes care to distinguish between real case of invalid
transaction versus system failure, later the error propagated down to
the committer and forces peer to stop with panic, so admin will be able
to take manual control and fix the problem therefore preventing peer
state to diverge.

[FAB-5446] Fix orderer metadata local test

The orderer metadata test only works if the development environment is
setup to set common.Version, because if this is not set, the version is
returned as "development version" and compared to the unset empty

This is very annoying when trying to do development locally as this test
always fails.

This CR simply overrides the common.Version value for the purpose of
testing this package.

[FAB-5391]Prevent concurrent invokes launching cc cont

This CR prevents concurrent invokes from launching a chaincode
container at the same time (e.g. during performance testing). The first
invoke should succeed (and launch the container) while subsequent
invokes should fail until the container has finished launching.

Note: This does not change any behavior as subsequent invokes should
have failed but it now sends a clear error message that the chaincode
container is already launching.

[FAB-5459] Recompute configmap instead of updating

The configtx validation code works by transforming the ConfigGroup tree
structure into a map, where each config element has a fully qualified
key like:

  [Groups] /Channel/Application

or

  [Policy] /Channel/Application/Readers

This flattened structure makes it easier to check which elements have
been modified, as the maps may simply be iterated over, rather than
walking the config tree.

After applying a config update, the current config map is copied, and
the elements which were updated are overlayed onto the old config.  This
map is then converted back into a tree structure and serialized to be
the new config tree.

The current code adopts the updated config map as the current config
map.  However, this produces the bug described in 5459.  Because the
updated config map is the overlay of the new config onto the old
config, the updated config may contain orphaned nodes which appear in
the map, but which do not appear in the config tree.

Consequently, when a subsequent update arrives, it is validated not
only against the current config, but also against the orphaned nodes
which are still in the updated config map.

This CR changes the logic to discard the updated config map (which may
contain this orphaned nodes) and instead has the config map recomputed
every time a new config is adopted.  This is more obviously
deterministic and mimics the way a new ordering node would initialize
the config after being restarted.

Note: There is no accompanying test case with this.  I had originally
written a test case which demonstrated that nodes were orphaned in the
updated config.  However, this is expected and not a useful test case.
Similarly, forcing the update config map to have updated nodes, then
testing that that map is not adopted does not provide a valuable test
case.

So, instead of a test, this CR opts for some code comments and this
lengthly commit explaining the change.

[FAB-5329] Able to instantiate on a taken chaincode ID

This fix appends a hash of the Docker image name to the image name

the container of an already instantiated chaincode. This problem was
introduced by the need to convert all Docker image names to lowercase.
The Docker container name will retain its capitalization as that
restriction only applies to the image name.

[FAB-5525] Fix configtx memory allocation bug

The configtx code uses an 'append(...)' against a slice, and records the
new slice address when computing the config map.  Through sheer dumb
luck, this code works for config groups which are only nested 2 levels
deep, because the append call triggers a true new memory allocation.
However, for config groups 3 levels deep (such as consortium groups),
the append call actually re-uses the underlying memory for the slice.

This causes the path to be corrupted internally for the consortium group
items, and cause the wrong policy to be resolved when checking for a
policy which has been specified relatively.

This fix manually allocates new memory, copies it, and then appends the
element.
