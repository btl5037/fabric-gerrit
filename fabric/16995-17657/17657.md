This CR serves as a good example of integration test vs unit test approaches.  I've added comments about the test approach in the specific files, in order to get feedback from Matt.

Matt, for scenarios like this, what approach would you recommend?

1) go test for the lower level API unit test only, and use another framework for the higher level API integration test

2) go test for both the higher level API integration test and lower level API unit test (some duplication of test code).

3) go test for the lower level API unit test only, and allow developer to use their judgement on whether to include or skip the integration test on the higher level API.

4) go test for the higher level API integration test only, and allow developer to use their judgement on whether to include or skip the lower level API unit test, since both packages are within ledger component and can essentially be tested together as a unit, even though they cross package boundaries.</pre><strong>Reviewer</strong>: Matthew Sykes - sykesmat@us.ibm.com<br><strong>Reviewed</strong>: 2/12/2018, 12:21:46 PM<br><strong>Message</strong>: <pre>Patch Set 1:

> 1) go test for the lower level API unit test only, and use another framework for the higher level API integration test

In this case, option 1a. The implementation and the test should live together. If there are multiple implementations that share a common behavior, the validation of the shared behavior should be extracted to test functions (not named TestXXX but that still take a *testing.T) that are defined in test package that corresponds to the interface encapsulating the shared behavior.

Then, next to the concrete implementations, create TestXXX functions that call the shared behavior test function. This keeps a single definition of the behavior next to the contract and keeps the tests executing next to the implementations.

Also, integration tests are about ensuring things work together; it's not about ensuring that a single block of code that's part of one implementation detail is exercised; it's also not about test or code reuse.

Matt, I second to you on the aspect of shared tests for different implementations. In fact, if you look at the statedb implementation, that's exactly how we have organized it there.

https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/tree/release/core/ledger/kvledger/txmgmt/statedb/commontests hosts the test that are invoked from both stateleveldb and statecouchdb packages.</pre><strong>Reviewer</strong>: Matthew Sykes - sykesmat@us.ibm.com<br><strong>Reviewed</strong>: 2/12/2018, 2:48:06 PM<br><strong>Message</strong>: <pre>Patch Set 1:

Please backfill unit tests for validation in the lock based tx manager as well. The stuff that's being done in integration should really have been implemented as units when validation was initially added.

Also, regarding all previous comments about "shared behavior." I was under the misguided assumption that this CR was a WIP and that there was, in fact, shared behavior. It's clear that's not the case. While I stand by my comments, they simply don't apply here. I apologize for the confusion.</pre><strong>Reviewer</strong>: David Enyeart - enyeart@us.ibm.com<br><strong>Reviewed</strong>: 2/13/2018, 9:40:43 AM<br><strong>Message</strong>: <pre>Patch Set 1:

But in this case, an unmarshaling error is not a typical error, it simply indicates that the content is not json and therefore does not require the additional checking for reserved json fields.

Manish, I'd recommend add a comment to explain this, since the ignoring of the error is indeed unintuitive and not following the typical error handling pattern.</pre><strong>Commenter</strong>: Matthew Sykes - sykesmat@us.ibm.com<br><strong>CommentLine</strong>: [core/ledger/kvledger/txmgmt/statedb/statecouchdb/statecouchdb.go#L247](https://github.com/hyperledger-gerrit-archive/fabric/blob/45c6ca471e713fb94371a81f485235186fee0be5/core/ledger/kvledger/txmgmt/statedb/statecouchdb/statecouchdb.go#L247)<br><strong>Comment</strong>: <pre>I guess I don't understand the interaction between non-json payloads and the reserved fields.

But in some cases a chaincode will want to store unstructured binary data, and in that case when couchdb is chosen as state database we store the value as an 'attachment' in CouchDB with a dummy json header that we provide.  So in these cases we don't need to check the chaincode provided value for reserved fields and can simply return nil here.

I agree the idiomatic check for error and return of nil, followed by happy path, would be better here.</pre><strong>Commenter</strong>: Manish Sethi - manish.sethi@gmail.com<br><strong>CommentLine</strong>: [core/ledger/kvledger/txmgmt/statedb/statecouchdb/statecouchdb.go#L247](https://github.com/hyperledger-gerrit-archive/fabric/blob/45c6ca471e713fb94371a81f485235186fee0be5/core/ledger/kvledger/txmgmt/statedb/statecouchdb/statecouchdb.go#L247)<br><strong>Comment</strong>: <pre>Done</pre><strong>Commenter</strong>: David Enyeart - enyeart@us.ibm.com<br><strong>CommentLine</strong>: [core/ledger/kvledger/txmgmt/statedb/statecouchdb/statecouchdb.go#L249](https://github.com/hyperledger-gerrit-archive/fabric/blob/45c6ca471e713fb94371a81f485235186fee0be5/core/ledger/kvledger/txmgmt/statedb/statecouchdb/statecouchdb.go#L249)<br><strong>Comment</strong>: <pre>This code is covered in the lockbasedtxmgr integration test, but is not covered in the statecouchdb unit test.</pre><strong>Commenter</strong>: David Enyeart - enyeart@us.ibm.com<br><strong>CommentLine</strong>: [core/ledger/kvledger/txmgmt/statedb/statecouchdb/statecouchdb_test.go#L205](https://github.com/hyperledger-gerrit-archive/fabric/blob/45c6ca471e713fb94371a81f485235186fee0be5/core/ledger/kvledger/txmgmt/statedb/statecouchdb/statecouchdb_test.go#L205)<br><strong>Comment</strong>: <pre>The tests here need to be extended to include reserved field JSON tests, in order to get unit test code coverage in the statecouchdb package.</pre><strong>Commenter</strong>: Matthew Sykes - sykesmat@us.ibm.com<br><strong>CommentLine</strong>: [core/ledger/kvledger/txmgmt/statedb/statecouchdb/statecouchdb_test.go#L205](https://github.com/hyperledger-gerrit-archive/fabric/blob/45c6ca471e713fb94371a81f485235186fee0be5/core/ledger/kvledger/txmgmt/statedb/statecouchdb/statecouchdb_test.go#L205)<br><strong>Comment</strong>: <pre>> The tests here need to be extended to include reserved field JSON tests, in order to get unit test code coverage in the statecouchdb package.

This is an integration test across lockbasedtxmgr and the various statedbs.

Benefits:
- Provides test coverage in the higher level lockbasedtxmgr API, the lower level statedb APIs, and the integration of the higher level and lower level APIs, as they are actually used in the real system.
- Test can be written once and then easily executed across N lower level statedb APIs.</pre><strong>Commenter</strong>: Matthew Sykes - sykesmat@us.ibm.com<br><strong>CommentLine</strong>: [core/ledger/kvledger/txmgmt/txmgr/lockbasedtxmgr/txmgr_test.go#L640](https://github.com/hyperledger-gerrit-archive/fabric/blob/45c6ca471e713fb94371a81f485235186fee0be5/core/ledger/kvledger/txmgmt/txmgr/lockbasedtxmgr/txmgr_test.go#L640)<br><strong>Comment</strong>: <pre>In my opinion, this style of assertion is too far from the behavior implemented in the code. Since it lives in a different package, it's unlikely quick iteration in statedb will execute these tests.

This is also testing a code block in code, not interactions between segments or components of code so they aren't really "integration" tests.

If you're looking to test "shared behavior" - that's a different kind of test style that we can discuss. In that model, the definition of the behavior lives an a package that defines the interface being implemented. Concrete implementations are then tested from within the implementation package by passing the instance under test to the shared validation code. This results in test failures while iterating and still validates common behaviors across all implementations.</pre><strong>Commenter</strong>: David Enyeart - enyeart@us.ibm.com<br><strong>CommentLine</strong>: [core/ledger/kvledger/txmgmt/txmgr/lockbasedtxmgr/txmgr_test.go#L640](https://github.com/hyperledger-gerrit-archive/fabric/blob/45c6ca471e713fb94371a81f485235186fee0be5/core/ledger/kvledger/txmgmt/txmgr/lockbasedtxmgr/txmgr_test.go#L640)<br><strong>Comment</strong>: <pre>I agree ValidateKeyValue() should be unit tested in the lower level packages stateleveldb and statecouchdb.

This test tests the integration of SetState() and the lower level ValidateKeyValue() functions, and validates that SetState() behaves correctly for various ValidateKeyValue() responses.  It therefore seems like a legitimate "integration" test to me.  I guess I'm not understanding why you don't think these are integration tests.</pre><strong>Commenter</strong>: Matthew Sykes - sykesmat@us.ibm.com<br><strong>CommentLine</strong>: [core/ledger/kvledger/txmgmt/txmgr/lockbasedtxmgr/txmgr_test.go#L640](https://github.com/hyperledger-gerrit-archive/fabric/blob/45c6ca471e713fb94371a81f485235186fee0be5/core/ledger/kvledger/txmgmt/txmgr/lockbasedtxmgr/txmgr_test.go#L640)<br><strong>Comment</strong>: <pre>Honestly, i can't easily tell what this is testing. testEnvs is like magic since it's not part of the diff. Even though I can't see it, since it's used everywhere, it appears the setup is constant and does not change between tests so I largely ignored it.

What I can see is that for each of them, the test values (which are only unhappy, reserved path values using keys that match constants defined elsewhere - a relevant detail, imo) are provided to the environments. That implies that we're only focusing on the bit of code that was added in ValidateKeyValue. If that's the case, we're driving out those paths from here and that isn't exercising the interactions between components but driving out a single block of code from a remote call site. To me, this seems more about testing shared behavior than about testing integration.

Now, you're stating that you expect each implementation to have unit tests for the reserved fields. Great. You also state that you want this block of code to exercise the interaction between the simulator state management and the validation being done at the db layer. I agree that at some level, that is an integration test. Where I think we diverge is that I don't see the value of testing that aspect here. Instead I would expect there to be a unit test that ensures that object providing validation (DB in this case) is called appropriately when SetState is called. There would then be additional unit tests to ensure that validation failures result in an error. Those would live next to the lockbased_tx_simulator and employ a fake db/validator.

For me, the tests that create a simulator, set state, validate and commit the rwset, then ensure the data can be retrieved from the ledger (using concrete implementations) are the ones I think of as "integration" tests.</pre><strong>Commenter</strong>: David Enyeart - enyeart@us.ibm.com<br><strong>CommentLine</strong>: [core/ledger/kvledger/txmgmt/txmgr/lockbasedtxmgr/txmgr_test.go#L640](https://github.com/hyperledger-gerrit-archive/fabric/blob/45c6ca471e713fb94371a81f485235186fee0be5/core/ledger/kvledger/txmgmt/txmgr/lockbasedtxmgr/txmgr_test.go#L640)<br><strong>Comment</strong>: <pre>I agree the detailed reserved field testing should be done down in statecouchdb.

And I agree testing with a fake would be sufficient for testing the integration.

There are two testEnvs that are tested throughout this package, one for statecouchdb and one for stateleveldb, representing the two implementations of the statedb VersionedDB interface.

I still think there is value in testing at least one reserved field against the real statecouchdb impl and real stateleveldb impl, to verify that when SetState is integrated with the real state databases that we do in fact get an error against statecouchdb but no error against stateleveldb.  That is in fact the ultimate objective here.</pre><strong>Commenter</strong>: Matthew Sykes - sykesmat@us.ibm.com<br><strong>CommentLine</strong>: [core/ledger/kvledger/txmgmt/txmgr/lockbasedtxmgr/txmgr_test.go#L640](https://github.com/hyperledger-gerrit-archive/fabric/blob/45c6ca471e713fb94371a81f485235186fee0be5/core/ledger/kvledger/txmgmt/txmgr/lockbasedtxmgr/txmgr_test.go#L640)<br><strong>Comment</strong>: <pre>I won't continue to argue the point but having the test here is redundant. After our chat yesterday, it's clear this isn't a WIP item and we're not looking at shared behavior. The point of this change request is to add policing to a single database backend. The code in support of that validation should live with that backend and not find its way out of that organizational unit.</pre></blockquote><h3>PatchSet Number: 2</h3><blockquote><strong>Type</strong>: REWORK<br><strong>Author</strong>: Manish Sethi - manish.sethi@gmail.com<br><strong>Uploader</strong>: Manish Sethi - manish.sethi@gmail.com<br><strong>Created</strong>: 2/13/2018, 10:02:48 AM<br><strong>UnmergedRevision</strong>: [25aa6d9bbb35af0c5c1f33bfe4e4f9abaf0c5b7d](https://github.com/hyperledger-gerrit-archive/fabric/commit/25aa6d9bbb35af0c5c1f33bfe4e4f9abaf0c5b7d)<br><br><strong>Approver</strong>: Hyperledger Jobbuilder - jobbuilder@jenkins.hyperledger.org<br><strong>Approved</strong>: 2/13/2018, 10:50:49 AM<br><strong>Type</strong>: Verified<br><strong>Value</strong>: -1<br><br></blockquote><h3>PatchSet Number: 3</h3><blockquote><strong>Type</strong>: REWORK<br><strong>Author</strong>: Manish Sethi - manish.sethi@gmail.com<br><strong>Uploader</strong>: Manish Sethi - manish.sethi@gmail.com<br><strong>Created</strong>: 2/13/2018, 12:55:13 PM<br><strong>GitHubMergedRevision</strong>: [0cf175631e1d020b0d759501a3200eee9816118b](https://github.com/hyperledger-gerrit-archive/fabric/commit/0cf175631e1d020b0d759501a3200eee9816118b)<br><br><strong>Approver</strong>: Hyperledger Jobbuilder - jobbuilder@jenkins.hyperledger.org<br><strong>Approved</strong>: 2/13/2018, 1:31:16 PM<br><strong>Type</strong>: Verified<br><strong>Value</strong>: 1<br><br><strong>Approver</strong>: Jason Yellick - jyellick@us.ibm.com<br><strong>Approved</strong>: 2/14/2018, 5:11:17 PM<br><strong>Type</strong>: Code-Review<br><strong>Value</strong>: 1<br><br><strong>MergedBy</strong>: Jason Yellick<br><strong>Merged</strong>: 2/14/2018, 5:14:30 PM<br><br><strong>Approver</strong>: David Enyeart - enyeart@us.ibm.com<br><strong>Approved</strong>: 2/13/2018, 1:13:47 PM<br><strong>Type</strong>: Code-Review<br><strong>Value</strong>: 1<br><br><h2>Comments</h2><strong>Commenter</strong>: David Enyeart - enyeart@us.ibm.com<br><strong>CommentLine</strong>: [core/ledger/kvledger/txmgmt/statedb/statecouchdb/statecouchdb.go#L247](https://github.com/hyperledger-gerrit-archive/fabric/blob/0cf175631e1d020b0d759501a3200eee9816118b/core/ledger/kvledger/txmgmt/statedb/statecouchdb/statecouchdb.go#L247)<br><strong>Comment</strong>: <pre>Matt was suggesting it would be more idiomatic go to check for the error and return nil first, and then proceed on to happy path logic.
