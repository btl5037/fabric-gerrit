This might be a controversial set of changes so I want to get it
out for comments

- switching s390x base image to debian for some unexplained legal reasons
  This does not affect common sections of setup and very minimally affect
  The s390x sections (mainly
- added IBM Java to s390x and ppcle
- javaenv patches. Things now compile, but there are GRPC errors to
  investigate (~"wrong frame size, expected 1024")
- Gradle support seems very dependent on specific versions. This is the
  Third attempt, and I decided to keep as close to current versions as
  possible.
- Added (partial) support for PPC and s390x in gradle via a dirty patch
  (since needed to keep the same version)
- Increased timeouts for several behave tests. At the time, my weak VM
  could not take it. Am getting a more powerful machine, but test cases
  should not depend on machine performance so much regardless, so keeping
  the 'fix'.
- 'Hack' chaintool too work in IBM java; -Xbootclasspath does not take
  executable jars. Need to work something out that uses -Xshareclasses on
  IBM Java conditionally

There is way too much here as several problems are trying to be resolved.   
1) I understand the move to Debian - can you break this part out into its own request?</pre><strong>Reviewer</strong>: Gari Singh - gari.r.singh@gmail.com<br><strong>Reviewed</strong>: 10/17/2016, 1:03:02 PM<br><strong>Message</strong>: <pre>Patch Set 1:

2) if you are still getting GRPC errors, why would we want to check this in?
3) how much do we really care about Java chaincode support for Power and Z at this point on the v0.6 branch?

1. It is a single line of code:
-DOCKER_BASE_s390x=s390x/ubuntu:xenial
+DOCKER_BASE_s390x=s390x/debian:jessie

This seemed like a trivial enough change that I included it in a single changeset.

2. Well.. not sure what you are suggesting here. Why would anyone check in a partial fix? The java code now compiles, isnt that something to check in? There are at least four or five people now on z that have been re-inveinventing this fix, I am hoping to short-circuit that waste of effort.

3. Hmm, I figured since javaenv is in the code, its something for us to try and get working. p/z working are just as important..</pre><strong>Reviewer</strong>: Christopher Ferris - chris.ferris@gmail.com<br><strong>Reviewed</strong>: 10/18/2016, 2:03:06 AM<br><strong>Message</strong>: <pre>Patch Set 1: Code-Review-2

AFAIK we agreed that Java chaincode did NOT need to be in ANY of the images for P and Z at this time.

Agree that this needs to be broken up into digestible and working chunks.</pre><strong>Reviewer</strong>: Volodymyr Paprotski - vpaprots@ca.ibm.com<br><strong>Reviewed</strong>: 10/18/2016, 12:02:08 PM<br><strong>Message</strong>: <pre>Patch Set 1:

Since two people agree, abandoning change set.

Since 0.6 has been cut, not sure if there is any value of me attempting to deliver this any longer.</pre><strong>Reviewer</strong>: Volodymyr Paprotski - vpaprots@ca.ibm.com<br><strong>Reviewed</strong>: 10/18/2016, 12:02:16 PM<br><strong>Message</strong>: <pre>Abandoned</pre><h1>PatchSets</h1><h3>PatchSet Number: 1</h3><blockquote><strong>Type</strong>: REWORK<br><strong>Author</strong>: Volodymyr Paprotski - vpaprots@ca.ibm.com<br><strong>Uploader</strong>: Volodymyr Paprotski - vpaprots@ca.ibm.com<br><strong>Created</strong>: 1476490036<br><strong>UnmergedRevision</strong>: c42bd1a41372e15eaaabbf9538c8ff47ca158374<br><br><strong>Approver</strong>: Christopher Ferris - chris.ferris@gmail.com<br><strong>Approved</strong>: 10/18/2016, 2:03:06 AM<br><strong>Type</strong>: Code-Review<br><strong>Value</strong>: -1<br><br><strong>Approver</strong>: Hyperledger Jobbuilder - jobbuilder@jenkins.hyperledger.org<br><strong>Approved</strong>: 10/14/2016, 9:35:56 PM<br><strong>Type</strong>: Verified<br><strong>Value</strong>: 1<br><br><strong>Approver</strong>: Gari Singh - gari.r.singh@gmail.com<br><strong>Approved</strong>: 10/17/2016, 1:01:25 PM<br><strong>Type</strong>: Code-Review<br><strong>Value</strong>: -1<br><br></blockquote>
