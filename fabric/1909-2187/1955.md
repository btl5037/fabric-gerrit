<strong>Project</strong>: fabric<br><strong>Branch</strong>: master<br><strong>ID</strong>: 1955<br><strong>Subject</strong>: Define Chain Configuration Protos<br><strong>Status</strong>: MERGED<br><strong>Owner</strong>: Jason Yellick - jyellick@us.ibm.com<br><strong>Assignee</strong>:<br><strong>Created</strong>: 10/24/2016, 4:59:35 PM<br><strong>LastUpdated</strong>: 10/25/2016, 2:47:45 PM<br><strong>CommitMessage</strong>:<br><pre>Define Chain Configuration Protos

In order to bootstrap a chain, certain configuration must be embedded in
its genesis block.  This configuration needs to be in a well defined
format so that it is easy for consumers to read.  Further, this
configuration must be able to be modified in the future, so must define
policy which dictates how modification is allowed.

This changeset defines a set of protobuf messages in ab.proto which are
designed to satisfy the above requirements.  The configuration is
essentially a list of configuration items, which have a name (string), a
type (enum), a payload (bytes), and a reference to a modification policy
(string).  Additionally a sequence number scheme is included to prevent
replay.

This changeset also defines a wrapper for the policy configuration item
type.  It references the small proto DSL for signature validation, but
embeds this in a one-of concept in case anyone wishes to swap in other
policy validation schemes.

This is related to, but does not completely satisfy:

Alternatively we could have required that keys be namespaced with dot notation (component.key) or some other scheme, but I figured why not leverage the proto stuff to make life a little simpler.  Not married to this if there's dissent though.</pre><strong>Commenter</strong>: Gari Singh - gari.r.singh@gmail.com<br><strong>CommentLine</strong>: [orderer/atomicbroadcast/ab.proto#L94](https://github.com/hyperledger-gerrit-archive/fabric/blob/4bead6804d0e81f86db16ffe46dd0be32aead373/orderer/atomicbroadcast/ab.proto#L94)<br><strong>Comment</strong>: <pre>I guess my assumption was that this message would be received by a Kafka orderer or a PBFT orderer but never by both of them.

My concern was, if there were a common 'Orderer' type, that it might not be obvious to someone trying to start a Kafka orderer against a chain which was configured for PBFT why a failure was occurring.  I do see the merits to collapsing those three to a single 'Orderer' type though.  Let me know if you'd prefer that and I can update.</pre><strong>Commenter</strong>: Gari Singh - gari.r.singh@gmail.com<br><strong>CommentLine</strong>: [orderer/atomicbroadcast/ab.proto#L94](https://github.com/hyperledger-gerrit-archive/fabric/blob/4bead6804d0e81f86db16ffe46dd0be32aead373/orderer/atomicbroadcast/ab.proto#L94)<br><strong>Comment</strong>: <pre>Ah - good point.
