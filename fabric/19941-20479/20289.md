For administrative operations, such as install
chaincode and join channel, no channel is yet
available to perform a channel-specific discovery.
By adding the ability to query for peers on an
empty channel, it makes it possible for an org
to discover its own peers in order to perform
such administrative operations.

This patch allows for a PeersQuery with an
empty channel. ConfigQuery and EndorserQuery
both return 'access denied' if channel is not
provided.

Thanks for the contribution but I don't think we should let any user in the channel - know all peers in the org, regardless of whether they are in the channel, or not.

I think only admins should be able to query for all peers a peer knows.

In any case I'd rather hold off with this change set at least until the playback on Monday and until I understand your needs for channel-less queries.</pre><strong>Reviewer</strong>: Bob Stasyszyn - bob.stasyszyn@securekey.com<br><strong>Reviewed</strong>: 4/7/2018, 2:55:10 PM<br><strong>Message</strong>: <pre>Patch Set 1:

Yes, I was thinking that an org should only be able to discover it's own peers - not peers in other orgs. And we should be able to restrict this to admins only. The Go SDK currently uses 'static' discovery for its resource management client. Static discovery is basically reading peers from a config file. We wanted to be able to have an org add a peer dynamically and clients not having to modify config files. This was the motivation for this patch.
