This patch disables sync of BlockIndexDB, StateLevelDB, and HistoryLevelDB.
This should work because all of these DBs can be recovered from block files,
which contents are still written to a disk with sync, even when a system crashes
before writing the data to the DB files.

Thanks Takuya for giving attention to this. 

As you mentioned in your commit message - yes, this should work in theory and this was precisely the intended goal of the design since day 1 (i.e., only sync IO would be performed while writing to block files; these files are like WAL to fabric).

Adding a bit history to this...

In the first cut impl, we used rocksdb that allowed a very useful config which made rocksdb entirely skip writing to it's internal WALs. In other words, under this config, rocksdb would write only to its mem table and the mem table would be flushed to disk when full. We exploited this in our first implementation.

However for some licensing issue, we had to replace rocksdb by goleveldb which did not expose any such config. Instead, goleveldb exposes the config of async write to WAL (it still performs these writes though). We continued with this async write for a while until hit into a bug that was uncovered by a crash scenario. Some investigation in goleveldb code suggested that this async write to it's WAL files could cause data loss under some crash scenario. I recall vaguely, thus was when new log file is started and a crash could cause data from new log file recovered while missing the previous data.

So, in nutshall, the best for us would be a db that does not manages its WALs and just guarantees the flushing of memdbs atomically in a sync manner. This will not only enable async writes but also reduce the amount of singnificantly.

If you are keen, I will encourage you if such a change can be managed to get in goleveldb?</pre><strong>Reviewer</strong>: Manish Sethi - manish.sethi@gmail.com<br><strong>Reviewed</strong>: 8/9/2019, 11:21:30 AM<br><strong>Message</strong>: <pre>Patch Set 2:

Hi Manish,

Thank you so much for your responses. FAB-6779 mentions an issue to rebuild block storage index not possible with multiple block storage files. I think that a patch 14955 add a test to build a block index from multiple block files and this test passed without sync.

Do we still need additional tests? For example, after creating multiple block files in a peer process, kill the peer process and restart the peer process.</pre><strong>Reviewer</strong>: Manish Sethi - manish.sethi@gmail.com<br><strong>Reviewed</strong>: 8/23/2019, 10:05:16 AM<br><strong>Message</strong>: <pre>Patch Set 2:

That test has nothing to do with the leveldb issue that I mentioned above. Additional test would not be easy in a control way because, it would need you to make a crash exactly as some point when the control is with the leveldb and also make sure that the async io is still not reached the disk by OS filesystem flush.</pre><strong>Reviewer</strong>: Manish Sethi - manish.sethi@gmail.com<br><strong>Reviewed</strong>: 10/1/2019, 2:19:52 PM<br><strong>Message</strong>: <pre>Patch Set 2:
