Given the tests in CI passed and an issue was generated, there has been a test escape. I don't see anything introduced in this CR that fixes that problem. So, at the very least, we need an integration test that we don't have today.

Also, would like to see the names updated and launchAndExecute removed.</pre><strong>Reviewer</strong>: Srinivasan Muralidharan - srinivasan.muralidharan99@gmail.com<br><strong>Reviewed</strong>: 5/22/2018, 8:13:35 AM<br><strong>Message</strong>: <pre>Patch Set 1:

The reason tests didn't fail was because proto.Unmarshal is not guaranteed to fail if using the wrong type. In this case Unmarshal succeeded when using Response instead of ChaincodeMessage. We could beef up the test to look for other fields etc but in the end, there is no foolproof way to detect this (note that this is internal and is not affected by user data). Will put out a patch to address other issues while we think of a good way to write a test for this.</pre><strong>Reviewer</strong>: Matthew Sykes - sykesmat@us.ibm.com<br><strong>Reviewed</strong>: 5/22/2018, 8:42:49 AM<br><strong>Message</strong>: <pre>Patch Set 1:

It had been more than a week so I picked this up. Current CR is https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/c/22095/ and it addresses the comments I had as well as restoring a failing test that was used to correct the issue.</pre><strong>Reviewer</strong>: Srinivasan Muralidharan - srinivasan.muralidharan99@gmail.com<br><strong>Reviewed</strong>: 5/22/2018, 8:51:22 AM<br><strong>Message</strong>: <pre>Patch Set 1:
