https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-602

The refactoring allows sharing of transaction execution and validation code across goleveldb and couchdb.
This refactoring also allows plugging-in different schemes for various aspects of transaction execution
such as maintianing isolation during simulation, validation and commit.

This is good refactoring, but I think we should pay more attention to the plugin model as I don't think we have good enough abstraction, especially in kvledger.go module. I think we should explicitly define a db plugin mgr.</pre><strong>Reviewer</strong>: Manish Sethi - manish.sethi@gmail.com<br><strong>Reviewed</strong>: 12/14/2016, 12:55:08 AM<br><strong>Message</strong>: <pre>Patch Set 2:

Binh, most of your comments are related to couchdb. I fully agree with those and in fact, that's what was the main reason of taking up this exercise of refactoring. Otherwise, there was a lot of duplicated code and mixed-up configurations.

However, in this change set, I have mainly defined the interfaces and moved the leveldb related code and common code related to transaction management behind those interfaces.

I have still left the couch code as is and in a separate commit this whole couch related stuff will be deleted. The only implementation required would be implementing the interface `kvledger/txmgmt/store/VersionedDB` which simply requires reading from and writing to couch.

So, I would appreciate if you can review from that point of view.</pre><strong>Reviewer</strong>: Manish Sethi - manish.sethi@gmail.com<br><strong>Reviewed</strong>: 12/14/2016, 1:06:55 AM<br><strong>Message</strong>: <pre>Patch Set 2:

Just to clarify my point explicitly, in the subsequent commit following is what is expected/planned.
1) package core/ledger/kvledger/txmgmt/couchdbtxmgmt will be deleted
2) An implementation of interface core/ledger/kvledger/txmgmt/store.VersionedDB will be provided for couchdb
3) KVLedger will be cleaned up to use only interfaces and not directly referring to couchdbtxmgmt.</pre><strong>Reviewer</strong>: David Enyeart - enyeart@us.ibm.com<br><strong>Reviewed</strong>: 12/14/2016, 4:24:45 AM<br><strong>Message</strong>: <pre>Patch Set 2:

Hi Manish, I like the structure overall. I have a few naming suggestions to make things more clear.

Is there a reason to leave the refactor half baked?  Seems switching over the CouchDB stuff would prove out that the new structure makes sense across data stores.  Otherwise we may start to refactor CouchDB later and discover more changes needed in the new structure. I realize you were probably trying to minimize size of the changeset, but in a refactor you kind of have to go all the way to make sure everything holds together well.</pre><strong>Reviewer</strong>: Gari Singh - gari.r.singh@gmail.com<br><strong>Reviewed</strong>: 12/14/2016, 4:32:10 AM<br><strong>Message</strong>: <pre>Patch Set 2:

Dave, yes I was planning to stage the refactoring. But if everyone is of opinion that couch should also be done at the same time, let me do that as well. Was just fearful that It would keep getting conflicts.</pre><strong>Reviewer</strong>: Manish Sethi - manish.sethi@gmail.com<br><strong>Reviewed</strong>: 12/14/2016, 5:23:09 AM<br><strong>Message</strong>: <pre>Patch Set 2:

About the namings, I will change some of the names based on your suggestion. However, specifically about - store vs state, the idea was that store can be reused across state and history because eventually history is nothing but a multi-version store and hence can inherit from store.</pre><strong>Reviewer</strong>: Manish Sethi - manish.sethi@gmail.com<br><strong>Reviewed</strong>: 12/14/2016, 5:30:46 AM<br><strong>Message</strong>: <pre>Patch Set 2:

Dave, about refactoring the couch code. As you know, it's a bit half baked (such a version numbers etc are hardcoded..) do you want me to take care of these? Because, without that and proper tests it won't justify what you said?</pre><strong>Reviewer</strong>: David Enyeart - enyeart@us.ibm.com<br><strong>Reviewed</strong>: 12/14/2016, 9:29:04 AM<br><strong>Message</strong>: <pre>Patch Set 2:

Manish, I'll defer to you how you want to stage it, I'm fine with whatever you think is most logical/efficient.  The bottleneck on getting the versioning in CouchDB was whether we introduce a wrapper or not above the chaincode JSON.  We just decided to use the wrapper, and therefore that work can proceed.  In fact I was going to do it today.</pre><strong>Reviewer</strong>: Manish Sethi - manish.sethi@gmail.com<br><strong>Reviewed</strong>: 12/14/2016, 10:01:57 AM<br><strong>Message</strong>: <pre>Patch Set 2:

Dave I think this mixed approach would be surely inefficient. By mixed approach, I mean that you modify the existing code and then re-write based on refactored code. I think that either, we should merge this commit and work on couch on top or I can include couch also within this commit.</pre><strong>Reviewer</strong>: Binh Nguyen - binh1010010110@gmail.com<br><strong>Reviewed</strong>: 12/14/2016, 10:57:00 AM<br><strong>Message</strong>: <pre>Patch Set 2:

I think we should address the obvious comments here (like on couchdb_txmgr) and merge this cr then work on further refactoring.</pre><strong>Reviewer</strong>: Manish Sethi - manish.sethi@gmail.com<br><strong>Reviewed</strong>: 12/14/2016, 12:05:13 PM<br><strong>Message</strong>: <pre>Uploaded patch set 3.</pre><strong>Reviewer</strong>: Hyperledger Jobbuilder - jobbuilder@jenkins.hyperledger.org<br><strong>Reviewed</strong>: 12/14/2016, 12:08:20 PM<br><strong>Message</strong>: <pre>Patch Set 3:

Saw comment regarding a staged approach to this refactor and that this is a refactor of existing code - but the level implementation should eventually going under util so that it can be used by History as well.</pre><strong>Reviewer</strong>: Hyperledger Jobbuilder - jobbuilder@jenkins.hyperledger.org<br><strong>Reviewed</strong>: 12/14/2016, 12:41:34 PM<br><strong>Message</strong>: <pre>Patch Set 3: Verified+1
