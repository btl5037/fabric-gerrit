<strong>Project</strong>: fabric<br><strong>Branch</strong>: master<br><strong>ID</strong>: 33019<br><strong>Subject</strong>: FAB-16353 Move proposal validation to endorser<br><strong>Status</strong>: MERGED<br><strong>Owner</strong>: Jason Yellick - jyellick@us.ibm.com<br><strong>Assignee</strong>:<br><strong>Created</strong>: 8/20/2019, 12:52:46 AM<br><strong>LastUpdated</strong>: 8/21/2019, 9:23:07 AM<br><strong>CommitMessage</strong>:<br><pre>FAB-16353 Move proposal validation to endorser

This is the first CR in a series which simply cleans up the endorser.go
code.  The endorser package is the only consumer of the
core/common/validation.ValidateProposal code, and it's not at all clear
why this code was put into the command package instead put to live with
th endorser to begin with.

Note, this CR does delete quite a bit of (bad) tests.  This code as
copied also relies on evil things like the mspmgt singleton.  Because of
this, no tests have been added.  Instead, the code overall will be
refactored with good tests added towards the end.  Ideally this series
should merge all at once to avoid any transient gaps in code coverage.

Jason can we find a way of keeping fullflow_test.go alive - in some form? That test was connecting
 - proposal message generation
 - proposal message validation
 - proposal response message generation
 - proposal response message validation
 - tx message generation
 - tx message validation
which I find a very useful assurance against unintended msg generation/validation changes. If now is not a good time, could we please create a JIRA to track this? Thoughts?</pre><strong>Reviewer</strong>: Matthew Sykes - sykesmat@us.ibm.com<br><strong>Reviewed</strong>: 8/20/2019, 8:42:38 AM<br><strong>Message</strong>: <pre>Patch Set 1:

I'm happy to open a JIRA, and I think in general, we could use more non-e2e style integration tests, ones which wire together components of Fabric to make sure they work as anticipated but without the overhead of spinning up a full network.  Though hopefully, this path is actually covered in our e2e integration tests as well.

That being said, I find the utility of this test to be a little lacking, and my overall concern with this method of testing (which I see quite a bit in the validation path) is that by relying on utils to generate all of your inputs, the inputs are by and large well formed, and error paths are not driven out.  These tests are also especially gross in that they rely on the msp singleton structures, so, I think it's better to remove and re-add.

I've gone ahead and opened a JIRA:

Thanks Jason for creating the JIRA. I agree that the reliance on the msp singleton is a bad idea, and that we could add more negative tests. However I believe in the usefulness of those tests because - if we architect them well - they are excellent ways of just testing the protocol, asserting what messages are properly formed and what aren't and defining *THE* standard way in which protocol messages have to be generated and validated.</pre><strong>Reviewer</strong>: Matthew Sykes - sykesmat@us.ibm.com<br><strong>Reviewed</strong>: 8/21/2019, 8:59:01 AM<br><strong>Message</strong>: <pre>Patch Set 1: Code-Review+2
