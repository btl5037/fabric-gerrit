Something I was just thinking about this morning is how the channel MSP is not actually a physical MSP in itself (or called as such anywhere in the code). It's a r*elationship* between the identities of channel members (which themselves are MSPs) and the enforcement of channel level policies. 

So it's an MSP in notion, rather than in substance. Which is why it has always been called a channel MSP. 

But the same logical relationship also exists for endorsement policies. These are, in a sense, transaction MSPs, since they do the same job as a channel MSP in linking an identity (again, in this sense, an Org MSP) with a role (an endorsing organization), and performs its own enforcing of the policies listed therein. 

Now, it might be a bit galling to extend a naming convention that already isn't popular to areas it hasn't already colonized, but from a conceptual standpoint if we're going to be talking about how MSPs turn identities into roles, it might be helpful to show other areas where this is being done in the network. To application developers in particular.</pre><strong>Reviewer</strong>: Jim Mason - jmason900@yahoo.com<br><strong>Reviewed</strong>: 11/18/2019, 12:17:10 PM<br><strong>Message</strong>: <pre>Patch Set 3:

I agree with your concept that MSPs are assigned roles. Our doc should make clear that an org can have 1 or more MSPs associated and that an MSP can be assigned roles to manage access for a variety of objects - system, channel, org, transactions etc.</pre><strong>Reviewer</strong>: Pam Andrejko - pama@ibm.com<br><strong>Reviewed</strong>: 11/19/2019, 3:53:42 PM<br><strong>Message</strong>: <pre>Uploaded patch set 4.</pre><strong>Reviewer</strong>: Pam Andrejko - pama@ibm.com<br><strong>Reviewed</strong>: 11/19/2019, 3:54:12 PM<br><strong>Message</strong>: <pre>Patch Set 4:

The important point here I think is that the identity is useless unless it is tied to a role/permission. Certificates are just certificates. In the identity doc we use the analogy of a credit card. An identity without an role/permission (an MSP) is like a credit card that isn't tied to a bank account. It's "identifying", in a way, but not useful.</pre><strong>Commenter</strong>: Pam Andrejko - pama@ibm.com<br><strong>CommentLine</strong>: [docs/source/membership/membership.md#L9](https://github.com/hyperledger-gerrit-archive/fabric/blob/2bb99f95654f680dd3c19b7e8541c83dcddfedff/docs/source/membership/membership.md#L9)<br><strong>Comment</strong>: <pre>Good point.

Again, I think the point here is that the MSP is the thing that turns an identity (nice, but useless on its own) into a role (a set of permissions). 

It might also be worth mentioning that MSPs define organizations and are recognized by other organizations. Extending the credit card analogy, it's like having a credit card that is recognized by vendors you want to buy things from.</pre><strong>Commenter</strong>: Pam Andrejko - pama@ibm.com<br><strong>CommentLine</strong>: [docs/source/membership/membership.md#L15](https://github.com/hyperledger-gerrit-archive/fabric/blob/2bb99f95654f680dd3c19b7e8541c83dcddfedff/docs/source/membership/membership.md#L15)<br><strong>Comment</strong>: <pre>Helpful.

The local MSP of a peer doesn't represent an organization. Likewise, the channel MSP doesn't identity a network. Rather, they list roles and permissions at a particular level of administration. Local MSPs identity who has permissions at a node level. Likewise channel MSPs identify who has permissions at a channel level. 

The Org MSP might be the most notable (in that it identifies who the org admins are --- and in so doing, defines the org), but it is not the only MSP.</pre><strong>Commenter</strong>: Pam Andrejko - pama@ibm.com<br><strong>CommentLine</strong>: [docs/source/membership/membership.md#L35](https://github.com/hyperledger-gerrit-archive/fabric/blob/2bb99f95654f680dd3c19b7e8541c83dcddfedff/docs/source/membership/membership.md#L35)<br><strong>Comment</strong>: <pre>Good point.

I left it as trust domain for now but included your example. 

The MSP identifies which Root CAs and Intermediate CAs are accepted to define
the members of a trust domain, e.g. an organization, node, or channel", either by listing the
identities of their members, or by identifying which CAs are authorized to
issue valid identities for their members, or --- as will usually be the case ---
through a combination of both.</pre><strong>Commenter</strong>: Joe Alewine - Joe.Alewine@ibm.com<br><strong>CommentLine</strong>: [docs/source/membership/membership.md#L46](https://github.com/hyperledger-gerrit-archive/fabric/blob/2bb99f95654f680dd3c19b7e8541c83dcddfedff/docs/source/membership/membership.md#L46)<br><strong>Comment</strong>: <pre>This is always what an MSP does within the context in which it exists. The Org MSPs are a bit different in that the channel MSP is something of a superset of the org MSP, since the channel MSP gives rights/roles/permissions to organizations within that channel. The org admin (listed in the MSP) has the right to act on behalf of the org. But the org itself might have a limited set of permissions outlined in the channel MSP.</pre><strong>Commenter</strong>: Pam Andrejko - pama@ibm.com<br><strong>CommentLine</strong>: [docs/source/membership/membership.md#L46](https://github.com/hyperledger-gerrit-archive/fabric/blob/2bb99f95654f680dd3c19b7e8541c83dcddfedff/docs/source/membership/membership.md#L46)<br><strong>Comment</strong>: <pre>I like what you said elsewhere: `MSPs turn identities into roles` and think I will start with that here.

Channel MSPs themselves contain Org MSPs. These Org MSPs list admins (and users, etc). Local MSPs, on the other hand, do not contain MSPs. They are, like an Org MSP, comprised of admins (and users, etc). This is gone into in more detail below, but it's worth noting it here as well because the channel MSP only makes sense in the context of Org MSPs. Nodes themselves don't contain an MSP so much as belong to an organization that is defined by an MSP (which is confusing, obviously).</pre><strong>Commenter</strong>: Pam Andrejko - pama@ibm.com<br><strong>CommentLine</strong>: [docs/source/membership/membership.md#L69](https://github.com/hyperledger-gerrit-archive/fabric/blob/2bb99f95654f680dd3c19b7e8541c83dcddfedff/docs/source/membership/membership.md#L69)<br><strong>Comment</strong>: <pre>Yes.

We need to jackhammer into people's heads that orgs are the fundamental building blocks (conceptually at least) of a network. It's Orgs that change channel configs. It's Orgs that are listed in endorsement policies. The peers perform these actions, but on behalf of Orgs. And Org MSPs define organizations. That's much more important than naming conventions and two MSPs within the logical org.</pre><strong>Commenter</strong>: Chris Gabriel - alaskadd@gmail.com<br><strong>CommentLine</strong>: [docs/source/membership/membership.md#L265](https://github.com/hyperledger-gerrit-archive/fabric/blob/2bb99f95654f680dd3c19b7e8541c83dcddfedff/docs/source/membership/membership.md#L265)<br><strong>Comment</strong>: <pre>What if you are not using a yaml file for config?  Is there any value in referencing that these role attributes can also be specified in the CA cli?

feature must be enabled for the network.` 

and moved it above the section which says 
In the example above, there are 4 possible `ROLES`:

   * client
   * peer
   * admin

An organization is often divided up into multiple organizational units (OUs), each of which has a certain set of responsibilities. Think of an OU as a department inside an organization.</pre></blockquote><h3>PatchSet Number: 4</h3><blockquote><strong>Type</strong>: REWORK<br><strong>Author</strong>: Pam Andrejko - pama@ibm.com<br><strong>Uploader</strong>: Pam Andrejko - pama@ibm.com<br><strong>Created</strong>: 11/19/2019, 3:53:42 PM<br><strong>UnmergedRevision</strong>: [e25075cb9805195f271efdd4ce789cfc7671b3c3](https://github.com/hyperledger-gerrit-archive/fabric/commit/e25075cb9805195f271efdd4ce789cfc7671b3c3)<br><br></blockquote>
