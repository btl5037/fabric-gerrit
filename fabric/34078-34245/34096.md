The Instance abstraction is used as the pivot for implementing
peer->chaincode connectors by creating a "ConnectorInstance" when
external chaincode type is specified in the chaincode package. This
is done by generalizing the external builder's current Instance type.
And obviously, this allows to add more chaincode behavior easily by
add more Instance types.

Hey Murali, thanks for putting this together.  I think we're close, but things are deviating a bit from the discussed design.  Notably, the externalbuilder should be invoked regardless of chaincode type, and the resulting binaries can signal back to the peer that the chaincode is remote, or should be launched.</pre><strong>Reviewer</strong>: Srinivasan Muralidharan - srinivasan.muralidharan99@gmail.com<br><strong>Reviewed</strong>: 10/29/2019, 9:28:43 AM<br><strong>Message</strong>: <pre>Patch Set 3:

Hey Jason,
The change to separate out the concrete externalbuilders.Instance into two types is at the root of all the changes.

But, I still don't think we need a new type here.  Why not simply hang another method off of the standard *Instance which is something like:

 func (i *Instance) ChaincodeServerInfo() (*ChaincodeServerInfo, error) {
     if !releaseContentsCheck() {
         return nil, nil
     }
     // parse and return the chaincode server info
 }

Then, in the launcher, we'll simply call that, and if it's nil, proceed to the start/wait/etc.</pre><strong>Commenter</strong>: Srinivasan Muralidharan - srinivasan.muralidharan99@gmail.com<br><strong>CommentLine</strong>: [core/container/externalbuilders/connectorinstance.go#L42](https://github.com/hyperledger-gerrit-archive/fabric/blob/0ebf9f2b1cb96cf5f76519d555f05c0835ad2e78/core/container/externalbuilders/connectorinstance.go#L42)<br><strong>Comment</strong>: <pre>"But, I still don't think we need a new type here.

I wonder if you missed the comment I had added below? That has some more information on why the instance separation is a better organization. FWIW, my first attempt was with the standard *Instance.

Bottom line the ConnectorInstance has its own version of start/stop/wait which is seamlessly used by chaincode package code (runtime_launcher and container_runtime. The current organization helps to keep the pattern and minimize special casing of the chaincode server model.</pre><strong>Commenter</strong>: Srinivasan Muralidharan - srinivasan.muralidharan99@gmail.com<br><strong>CommentLine</strong>: [core/container/externalbuilders/connectorinstance.go#L43](https://github.com/hyperledger-gerrit-archive/fabric/blob/0ebf9f2b1cb96cf5f76519d555f05c0835ad2e78/core/container/externalbuilders/connectorinstance.go#L43)<br><strong>Comment</strong>: <pre>"the run/wait/stop steps will do different things"

(I'm assuming you meant start/wait/stop ?)

Separating this out from main comment as this is the crux of the matter and pretty much touches all other comments.

If I understood this correctly, the suggestion is that the one original concrete externalbuilders.Instance's start/stop/wait will do different things based on metadata.

The problem with that is the connector model needs to maintain different information than the current launcher model (in addition to the different transport model, the Connector calls code inline than running a script opaquely). Having one concrete externalbuilders.Instance will force it to be a container for  multiple implementations (not to mention the if/then/else in start/wait/stop)

The separation into LauncherInstance and ConnectorInstance makes the separation clean. Other changes such as returning Instance interface instead of *Instance concrete type and exposing the metadata in NewInstance stem from this separation.

By the way the CR up the stack with the full implementation of ConnectorInstance might help clarify.</pre><strong>Commenter</strong>: Jason Yellick - jyellick@us.ibm.com<br><strong>CommentLine</strong>: [core/container/externalbuilders/connectorinstance.go#L43](https://github.com/hyperledger-gerrit-archive/fabric/blob/0ebf9f2b1cb96cf5f76519d555f05c0835ad2e78/core/container/externalbuilders/connectorinstance.go#L43)<br><strong>Comment</strong>: <pre>I did indeed miss this comment -- it's weirdly a different non-yellow color in my Gerrit UI.


So the real question here is whether we want to use the container abstraction for managing the connection lifecycle to the remote chaincode, or whether we want to manage that outside.

I see down-stack, that you have moved the build to the runtime launcher.  My thought had been that we do the build there, and, if it is a remotecc style chaincode, we no longer need to try to manage the container lifecycle, as it's done for us.

So, essentially we'd have Build, Release, if not remote, call into container_runtime.go, if remote, simply start the connection.  Starting the connection I would expect would be much easier to wire from runtime_launcher.go as you already have access to the handler resources that you need, so need to pass them to the instance.</pre><strong>Commenter</strong>: Srinivasan Muralidharan - srinivasan.muralidharan99@gmail.com<br><strong>CommentLine</strong>: [core/container/externalbuilders/connectorinstance.go#L43](https://github.com/hyperledger-gerrit-archive/fabric/blob/0ebf9f2b1cb96cf5f76519d555f05c0835ad2e78/core/container/externalbuilders/connectorinstance.go#L43)<br><strong>Comment</strong>: <pre>I was considering moving the connection mechanism to the chaincode package to live with runtime_launcher but that mechanism has to live in a type structure would look exactly like instance (we need a Instance like structure to hang the connection state) and we will be splitting the chaincode interaction in two packages. 

I agree the downside is to have to set the HandleChaincodeStream function on ConnectorInsstance to complete the stream setup. But it seemed a better trade off in that I get a uniform, coherent strategy for handling "instances" all in one place. It also provides a pattern for other potential Instances to follow.</pre><strong>Commenter</strong>: Jason Yellick - jyellick@us.ibm.com<br><strong>CommentLine</strong>: [core/container/externalbuilders/connectorinstance.go#L43](https://github.com/hyperledger-gerrit-archive/fabric/blob/0ebf9f2b1cb96cf5f76519d555f05c0835ad2e78/core/container/externalbuilders/connectorinstance.go#L43)<br><strong>Comment</strong>: <pre>I think my concern here, is that the abstraction that exists was designed for locally launched and managed chaincodes.

For instance, as we look down the stack, we see that Start(...) which used to take a CID and the peer connection info, now takes a more generic 'ConnectionInfo'.  In the case of a locally launched chaincode that connection into is generated by peer itself.  In the case of a remotely launched chaincode, that connection info which is passed in is actually the info that the launcher provided.  Basically, we are wiring the connection info out of the externalbuilder, into container.go, into the container_runtime.go, into runtime_launcher.go, back to container_runtime.go, back to container.go, back to externalbuilder, to the same *Instance which originated it.  It makes the API consistent, but also really strange.  It's the instance that knows how to connect to the chaincode, why is the instance being told how to connect?

Another place that doesn't really make sense to me is 'Wait()', there's nothing to wait on, the connection stays open, or it hangs up, and the launcher code cleans it up.

And finally 'Stop', can't actually stop the chaincode, all it can do is disconnect.

We've also introduced a new cyclical dependency in our wiring.  The chaincode package needs a reference to the containers, which needs a reference to the external builders, which needs a reference to the chaincode stream handler in the chaincode package.  So, the change must add

 +       // chaincode support's stream handler is used by peer to connect to chaincode server
 +       externalVM.ConnectionHandler = chaincodeSupport

to internal/peer/node/start.go

It basically seems to me like we're applying a lot of verbs which make sense for locally launched chaincode to the remote chaincode for the sake of interface re-use, when in fact they're quite different.

My feeling is, that if we simply add `ConnectionInfo` to the normal "*Instance', and in runtime launcher if there's connection info returned by the instance, use the existing go routine which would otherwise invoke Start()+Wait() to start the chaincode stream (of course falling back to use the old container_runtime.go path as needed).  Basically copy lines 151-190 of https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/c/fabric/+/34099/3/core/container/externalbuilders/connectorinstance.go#151 out of the connectorinstance and into the chaincode package to be referenced by runtime_launcher.go, hang lines 52-70 off of the existing *Instance, and I think it's more or less done?

> It also provides a pattern for other potential Instances to follow.

So I'm really wondering what that might be?  After this stack, we'll have two types of chaincode, locally launched, and remote.  What third type of instance are you thinking of?  It seems like to me that either:

a) The instance supplies the connection info to the launcher (remote)
b) The launcher supplies the connection info to the instance (local)

I don't really see any other possible permutations.  Even if we added a new non-externalbuidler chaincode type (say... for whatever reason we wanted to do some sort of native k8s to replace or supplement the docker platforms), we'd still be operating under this framework.</pre><strong>Commenter</strong>: Srinivasan Muralidharan - srinivasan.muralidharan99@gmail.com<br><strong>CommentLine</strong>: [core/container/externalbuilders/connectorinstance.go#L43](https://github.com/hyperledger-gerrit-archive/fabric/blob/0ebf9f2b1cb96cf5f76519d555f05c0835ad2e78/core/container/externalbuilders/connectorinstance.go#L43)<br><strong>Comment</strong>: <pre>My first approach was something like what you outlined (mirrors the "connector_runtime.go" approach in the now abandoned set) but I abandoned it as it messed up chaincode package with the "if chaincode server" type of checks along with doing the connection handling in multiple packages .... and thought that might be more objectionable ;-).  (Also I think I ran into something else but that may be due to my hesitation in touching the externalbuilders for chaincodeinfo.)

Its moot now, but let me do that for completeness.

There's another classification I think you miss. (i) those that are entirely script driven (run, build, etc)  and (ii) those that need peer interaction (as in calling a peer method). (i) is fully covered. The chaincode-as-server is an example of (ii).</pre><strong>Commenter</strong>: Jason Yellick - jyellick@us.ibm.com<br><strong>CommentLine</strong>: [core/container/externalbuilders/externalbuilders.go#L88](https://github.com/hyperledger-gerrit-archive/fabric/blob/0ebf9f2b1cb96cf5f76519d555f05c0835ad2e78/core/container/externalbuilders/externalbuilders.go#L88)<br><strong>Comment</strong>: <pre>You'll notice in a previous CR, we used to return an interface type, and this was explicitly changed to return the concrete type with a small shim in the node package.</pre><strong>Commenter</strong>: Srinivasan Muralidharan - srinivasan.muralidharan99@gmail.com<br><strong>CommentLine</strong>: [core/container/externalbuilders/externalbuilders.go#L88](https://github.com/hyperledger-gerrit-archive/fabric/blob/0ebf9f2b1cb96cf5f76519d555f05c0835ad2e78/core/container/externalbuilders/externalbuilders.go#L88)<br><strong>Comment</strong>: <pre>Right, the move to split the concrete Instance into two (LauncherInstance and ConnectorInstance) forced this change.

The contents of the metadata should be opaque to the external builder.  We should never be inspecting the type and making decisions/switches based on the value we find.  It's up to the externally invoked builder to choose whether to return information for a remote connection in the release step, or not.  The chaincode type could be "Murali", and so long as the external builder returns the right stuff during the release step, then we should treat is as external.</pre><strong>Commenter</strong>: Srinivasan Muralidharan - srinivasan.muralidharan99@gmail.com<br><strong>CommentLine</strong>: [core/container/externalbuilders/externalbuilders.go#L495](https://github.com/hyperledger-gerrit-archive/fabric/blob/0ebf9f2b1cb96cf5f76519d555f05c0835ad2e78/core/container/externalbuilders/externalbuilders.go#L495)<br><strong>Comment</strong>: <pre>Sorry, I had replaced that response but must have forgotten to hit save.

The check has to be made either in the external scripts (build, detect) or in the externalbuilders code (which is the approach I took). If in external scripts, that information has to be conveyed to externalbuilders. Are you suggesting non-nil return from ChaincodeServerInfo() (from the other comment) instead of checking md.Type here ?</pre><strong>Commenter</strong>: Jason Yellick - jyellick@us.ibm.com<br><strong>CommentLine</strong>: [core/container/externalbuilders/externalbuilders.go#L495](https://github.com/hyperledger-gerrit-archive/fabric/blob/0ebf9f2b1cb96cf5f76519d555f05c0835ad2e78/core/container/externalbuilders/externalbuilders.go#L495)<br><strong>Comment</strong>: <pre>The basic flow I see is:

Run Detect
Run Build
Run Release
// Inspect contents of Release dir, look for appropriately well-known file location which 
// indicates this is a remote cc, this could be a simple function off the instance like 'ConnectionInfo() (*ptr, error)
// which returns non-nil, nil in the event of remote cc.   Fork execution logic in runtime_launcher.go.</pre><strong>Commenter</strong>: Srinivasan Muralidharan - srinivasan.muralidharan99@gmail.com<br><strong>CommentLine</strong>: [core/container/externalbuilders/externalbuilders.go#L495](https://github.com/hyperledger-gerrit-archive/fabric/blob/0ebf9f2b1cb96cf5f76519d555f05c0835ad2e78/core/container/externalbuilders/externalbuilders.go#L495)<br><strong>Comment</strong>: <pre>yes, that'd be cleaner and delegate the decision to the script.  I'll look into using a "ConnectionInfo() (*ptr, error)" method (if we go with the current overall approach). 
Actually I have one such method in a CR up the stack.... I'd just need to pull that in.</pre><strong>Commenter</strong>: Jason Yellick - jyellick@us.ibm.com<br><strong>CommentLine</strong>: [core/container/externalbuilders/launcherinstance.go#L16](https://github.com/hyperledger-gerrit-archive/fabric/blob/0ebf9f2b1cb96cf5f76519d555f05c0835ad2e78/core/container/externalbuilders/launcherinstance.go#L16)<br><strong>Comment</strong>: <pre>A bit of a nit, but this is not godoc style and I'm not sure what it buys us.</pre><strong>Commenter</strong>: Srinivasan Muralidharan - srinivasan.muralidharan99@gmail.com<br><strong>CommentLine</strong>: [core/container/externalbuilders/launcherinstance.go#L16](https://github.com/hyperledger-gerrit-archive/fabric/blob/0ebf9f2b1cb96cf5f76519d555f05c0835ad2e78/core/container/externalbuilders/launcherinstance.go#L16)<br><strong>Comment</strong>: <pre>I originally had both instances in one file called instances.go where this comment acted as a seperation, I willl remove it.</pre><strong>Commenter</strong>: Jason Yellick - jyellick@us.ibm.com<br><strong>CommentLine</strong>: [internal/peer/node/start.go#L138](https://github.com/hyperledger-gerrit-archive/fabric/blob/0ebf9f2b1cb96cf5f76519d555f05c0835ad2e78/internal/peer/node/start.go#L138)<br><strong>Comment</strong>: <pre>This is the little shim I referred to elsewhere, which obviates the need to return an interface type in the builder.
