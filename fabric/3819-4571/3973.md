In one of the gossip tests we have a test that ensures that all goroutines
 stop after all gossip instances stop.
It sometimes fails because it detects a connection-related goroutine is still
 alive after instances are stopped.

I'm investigating this, but I would rather not have CI fail because of it,
as it's not a show-stopper and doesn't indicate a functionality isn't working,
but only a possible goroutine leak.

I would rather try reproduce the problem or try and figure
out how this can happen offline, and not have this fail CI.

did not cause any issues locally for me so this seems fine.  you might want to look at making sure you contain everything within the scope of each test (i.e. it seems odd to have a test which checks for goroutines and maybe you should not have the wait group scoped outside of each test?)   But I did not look into this is depth so I may be overlooking something</pre><strong>Reviewer</strong>: Yacov Manevich - yacovm@il.ibm.com<br><strong>Reviewed</strong>: 1/15/2017, 10:06:25 AM<br><strong>Message</strong>: <pre>Patch Set 1:

I'll elaborate: I have 6 tests that check all kinds of things in an integrate-test style of test (spawns/kills a set of gossip components and disseminates blocks, checks membership stuff, etc. etc.).

These 6 tests run in parallel to save time, and I have a 7th test that runs only when these 6 tests pass. 
That's the test that checks that no orphaned goroutines have been left.</pre><strong>Reviewer</strong>: Yacov Manevich - yacovm@il.ibm.com<br><strong>Reviewed</strong>: 1/15/2017, 10:12:16 AM<br><strong>Message</strong>: <pre>Patch Set 1:

Forgot to add: the reason the setup is as it is (the 7th test running after the 6 tests have finished) is that I can't check in each test that goroutines have been stopped because I have no way of differentiating which goroutines belong to which test.</pre><strong>Reviewer</strong>: Binh Nguyen - binh1010010110@gmail.com<br><strong>Reviewed</strong>: 1/15/2017, 5:41:36 PM<br><strong>Message</strong>: <pre>Patch Set 1: Code-Review+2</pre><strong>Reviewer</strong>: Gerrit Code Review - gerrit@hyperledger.org<br><strong>Reviewed</strong>: 1/15/2017, 5:41:42 PM<br><strong>Message</strong>: <pre>Change has been successfully merged by Binh Nguyen</pre><strong>Reviewer</strong>: Hyperledger Jobbuilder - jobbuilder@jenkins.hyperledger.org<br><strong>Reviewed</strong>: 1/15/2017, 5:44:31 PM<br><strong>Message</strong>: <pre>Patch Set 1:
